    "## A tutorial to analysis political insight leveraging LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The case study demonstrates how to Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to gain political insight based on a leaked [email](https://github.com/benhamner/hillary-clinton-emails?tab=readme-ov-file) dataset from Hillary Clinton's private email server. \n",
    "- The email dataset is a comprehensive collection of communications covering her entire tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. \n",
    "- It includes approximately 30,000 emails with a wide range of topics from official diplomatic communications to personal correspondences. \n",
    "- The release and subsequent analysis of these emails have played a crucial role in political debates, legal inquiries, and public discussions about transparency and security in government communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of analysis with a LLM\n",
    "- Input for LLM: emails with various political scenarios, historical events, or current affairs related to Israel\n",
    "- Task for LLM: analyze emails from a political, social, and economic perspective \n",
    "    - provide insights into the implications of these scenarios, \n",
    "    - how they reflect on Israel's domestic and foreign policy, and \n",
    "    - what potential outcomes or future developments could arise from them.\n",
    "- Output: analyze results\n",
    "    - No specific format is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset in this study\n",
    "A set of email summaries (138 paragraph) from the leaked email dataset\n",
    "- each summary is a summarization of an email containing the keyword \"Israel\"\n",
    "    - some emails is very long. LLMs have token limitation\n",
    "- summarization is done by Gemini \n",
    "    - Gemini API is [free](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)\n",

       "**1. Diplomatic Challenges and Negotiations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The emails reveal ongoing diplomatic efforts to facilitate peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, highlighting the complexities and challenges involved in negotiations.\n",

       "**2. Settlement Freeze and Construction:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The emails discuss the controversial issue of Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank, including the Obama administration's efforts to secure a settlement freeze and Israel's reluctance to fully comply.\n",
       "* They provide evidence of ongoing tensions between the US and Israel over this issue, which remains a significant obstacle to peace efforts.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Public Perception and International Pressure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The emails reflect the challenges faced by Israel in managing its international image, particularly in the wake of incidents like the Gaza Flotilla raid.\n",
       "* They show how the US administration attempted to mediate between Israel and the international community, emphasizing the importance of accountability and restraint.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Domestic Political Considerations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The emails provide glimpses into the domestic political dynamics within Israel, including the influence of right-wing parties and the challenges faced by Prime Minister Netanyahu in balancing their demands with international pressure.\n",
