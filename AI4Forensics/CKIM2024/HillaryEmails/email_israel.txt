And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\n(ironically entitled "Innocence of Muslims") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\n(or excuse) for the protests.\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\nMost Americans operate by a different "we." From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, "I\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\npeople everywhere."\n"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\nInternet," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. "The United States deplores any intentional effort to\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\nof our nation."\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as"This Is Water," novelist David\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the "natural, basic self-centeredness" that puts "me" at the center of\nthe world.\nThis unconscious "default setting" fosters the sort of "blind certainty" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that "default setting" — to\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

But his critique can be applied as well to another "default\nsetting" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of\nGive:5\nAccording to those who stormed the embassies, "Innocence of Muslims" was not made by an individual\n(whoever the shadowy "Sam Bacile" may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican.\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\nprotests turned deadly, condemning "the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."\nCNN\'s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed "Innocence of Muslims" are imprisoned in some\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world\'s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\nTheir film doesn\'t just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\ndupes.\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\nas "Sam Bacile" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that "Islam is a cancer."\nYou don\'t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\nand you don\'t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as "blind certainty."\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\nThe real "red line" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of "blind certainty," unacquainted with both the complexity and\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the "cloud of unknowing" that hovers over every major religion.\nThe great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not\nknow everything.\nThey knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of\nordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying\nthe world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.\nThe killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence\nof Islam."\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739590\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert\nto the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,\nin an effort to encourage additional defections.\n(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to\nsummarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzu•\nhas reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was\nthe commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in\nN\'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of\n1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops.

Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a\npsychological blow for Qaddall.)\nSeparately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a\ncomplete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who\nhave experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan\ntroops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.\nThis source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are\nreports of deaths among some Qaddafi\'s senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan\nleader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have\nbeen unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French\nPresident Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge\nfrom this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.\nSarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting\nGroups and Al Qa\'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.\nAccordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6\nnations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist\ngroups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the\nMuslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.\nThese sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following\nrebel figures in Benghazi:\nMESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi\'s former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan\nleaders most loyal follower.

('This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I\'m biased.\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country\'s peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere "bumps in the road." They are major issues that put our security at risk.\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We\'re not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\nour allies.\nAnd that\'s dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel\'s security is compromised, America could be\npulled into the maelstrom.\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We\'re unique in having earned that role not\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a "recovery" that barely deserves the name. Our national\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\nFinally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\nweeks\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president\'s policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating "daylight" between our two\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our "closest ally" in the Middle East to being only "one of our closest allies." It\'s a diplomatic message that will\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel\'s concerns about Iran as mere "noise" that he prefers to "block out." And at a time when\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who\nshare our values.\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\nthe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\nIt means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\nthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\nextremism.\nBut this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\nour values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.\nU.S. Department of State\nCase No. F-2015-04841\nDoc No. C05739629\nDate: 05/13/2015\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

('Just wanted to be sure you saw the Kurtzer op-ed, which ran Sunday in the Post. Kudos to Jonathan Prince for\ngetting this written and placed.\nThe Settlements Facts •\nBy Daniel Kurtzer\nSunday, June 14, 2009\nFaulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner\'s June 5 column,\n"The Settlements Myth," is one example.\nHere are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the "road map" for peace,\nwhich imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: "GO! [Government of Israel] immediately\ndismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all\nsettlement activity (including natural growth of settlements)."\nToday, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime\nMinister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush\'s\nApril 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security\nadviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing\nIsraeli building within the "construction line" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such\nunderstanding.\nThe first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that\nconstruction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements.\nThe idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building\nonly inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the\nbuilt-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of\nthese provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent.\nSecond, President Bush\'s 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which\nIsrael would retain "existing major Israeli population centers" in the West Bank "on the basis of mutually\nagreed changes. . . ." One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel\'s retaining some\nsettlements was predicated on there being an "agreed outcome" of negotiations. Despite Israel\'s contention that\nthis letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush\nEtzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or\nother areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.\nIn his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the "construction line," saying that "within the\nagreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition\nof the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria." However, there never were any "agreed principles\nof settlement activities." Moreover, the effort to define the "construction line" was never consummated: Israel\nand the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of\nsettlements. Weissglas\'s letter also promised "continuous action" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but\nIsrael removed almost none of them.\nThroughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel\'s continuing settlement activity.\nBut this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush\nadministration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding\ncontinued settlement activity.\nCommentators also focus on the Obama administration\'s reiteration that a freeze must include the "natural\ngrowth" of settlements. Krauthammer says that this "means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the\n1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies." This is nonsense. No one\nsuggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to\nbuild more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like\nAmericans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.\nThe pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993,\nwhen Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel\'s West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600.\nThe numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural\nincrease of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of "natural growth" in official\ndocuments started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 "road map," reflecting recognition that the\nconcept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing\npolicies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of\nachieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians\'\nresponsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure.\nPresident Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no" way justify Israeli failure to\nimplement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freeze\nall settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.\nThe writer, US. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies at\nPrinceton University\'s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.',)
('HRC: Back this morning from Asia.\nCongratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very\npositive.\nLet raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as\nI understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are\ntwo ways:\n1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a\nhandful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would\nrepresent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it\nwould trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about\nour effectiveness.\n2. The alternative would be for the administration to say:\na. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a\nsettlements freeze. This is a very welcome development.\nb. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of\nhousing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we\nhave expressed to them..\n•c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants\nan immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help\npromote a two-state solution.\nThis latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move\nforward.\nOf course, I am around if you want to discuss.\nGood luck in India. They are very excited about your visit.\nSandy',)

('sbwhoeop\nThursday, October 22, 2009 12:02 AM\nH\nfyi: Hague report and DeMint... Sid\nH: Here\'s the Guardian account of Hague\'s post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. S\nWilliam Hague addresses US fears over Tories\'\nEU allies\n•Hillary Clinton \'told antisemitism allegations are a smear\'\n•Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader\n• Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt\n• quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST\nWilliam Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives\' alliance with far-right parties in\nEurope during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.\nHague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives\' partners, some of whose members have taken part in\ncommemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in\nPoland.\nThe shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a\nsmear campaign by the Guardian and others.\nThe row has overshadowed Hague\'s visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking\npower.\nSpeaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland\'s Law and Justice party, was\nnot consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives\' European alliance, Hague\nsaid: "This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous."\nJewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links.\nThe state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or\nissues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: "I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging\ndiscussion on a broad range of issues, but can\'t get into details or substance of that discussion."\nHague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives\' Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a\nlesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues.\nHague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the\nBalkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change.\n"No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state\nClinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those," Hague said.\n"I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a\nsmear campaign against some of its members."\nHe noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in\nEurope and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. "These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,"\nHague said.\nAs for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, "five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that\nhave been criticised." Some were members of the Conservatives\' previous alliance, the European People\'s party.\nOn Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: "I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to\ndistinguish between Europe\'s institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find\na Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. "\nLater he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair\nwould be appointed "over my dead body".\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequel\nIran-Contra\'s Scary Sequel\nby Art Levine\nThe Daily Beast\nOctober 10, 2009 I 6:55pm\nRepublicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America.\nThe clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the\nGeorge W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South\nCarolina.\nA freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint\nis best known for boasting that health care would be the "Waterloo" that will "break" Obama. He recently\nprovoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to "assess" the crisis.\nThe Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who\nwas expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his "intransigence"\nin putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied\nmoney for DeMint\'s trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the\nDefense Department.\n"DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to\ndefend a coup," says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washington\'s Center for International\nPolicy.\n"Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by\nprovoking the [DeMint] holds," Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign\nRelations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: "These losers from the Bush administration who drove\nLatin American policy off a frickin\' cliff are trying to rescue their legacy," one aide told The Daily Beast.\nA number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American\npolicy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance\nagainst the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to\nappease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration "slow-walked" its\nresponse to the coup this summer, Sweig says.\nMore recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least\n$35 million and blocking Honduran officials\' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into\nserious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya.\nInformed observers say that indications of Micheletti\'s flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington\nand helped trigger DeMint\'s visit to buck up the regime\'s resistance.\nAn informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya\nlegal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the\nState Department\'s now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was\nsubsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which\nfound he engaged in "prohibited covert activities" by using public funds to attack Reagan\'s critics. Reich, who\nwas later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and\nis now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption.\n"Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say I\'m an architect of the Zelaya\ncoup," he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as "crap,"\nasserting they were only based on a fired House staffer\'s unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin\nAmerican history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reich\'s role: "It\'s kind of the origins of Swift\nBoating," he says. "It\'s all related to what he\'s doing now."\nConservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the\nworldwide condemnation of the coup. "It\'s not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,"\nReich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking\nThe New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on\nbehalf of the Micheletti regime. "I guess my facts interfered with [the] story," he says. "Can you believe some\nof my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?" A\nDeMint spokesman says the senator hasn\'t even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide\nsays they\'ve spoken to DeMint\'s staff.\nAdding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives\nsay are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelaya\'s regime. He\nhas firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: "I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges\nagainst me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya." But the rumors may add to his aura\nof power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. He\'s drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by\npenning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, "I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras."\nPerhaps the primary influence on DeMint\'s thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer\nMiguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the\nSenate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in\ninfluencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide\nto the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an\nassistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The\nNewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former\nambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute—\nnot as a paid agent for pro-regime forces.\nNoriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid-\nJuly. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings\nbetween supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to\nWashington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported,\noccurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran\nsupreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified\nin favor of the current regime. Noriega\'s office declined to return phone calls about his work.\nThe lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obama\'s\npicks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere\nAffairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown\nUniversity\'s Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National\nSecurity Council during President Clinton\'s second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western\nHemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\nin late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, "They\'re not polarizing figures."\nBut for now they\'re hostages in DeMint\'s war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint\nby defending the administration\'s decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: "In my studies of military\ncoups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup," Valenzuela said. DeMint\'s critics contend that he has\ncontinually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds,\nincluding the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees.\nDeMint\'s spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he\'s acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an\nimportant crisis. "If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasn\'t Senator Reid brought\nthem to the floor?" he asks. "There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on\nthem." Technically that\'s true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken\nup the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, "the State Department\'s actions were directly relevant to two\nnominees seeking the committee\'s approval."\nYet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to "break"\nObama—one congressional observer jokes, "He couldn\'t find Honduras on a map."\nArt Levine, a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly, has written for Mother Jones, The American\nProspect, The New Republic, The Atlantic, Slate.com, Salon. corn, and numerous other publications.

('See below. Will send PIR comments shortly.\nTo: CDM\nFr: Caitlin\nRe: Branch Book\nOverview:\nThere are few surprises in this book. The "surprises" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick\nup on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC\'s crime bill and why he hadn\'t disclosed\ninformation about Lewinsky (because he hadn\'t wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of\nthings that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and\nmuch more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as "and this day, and the next day" as My Life,\nit does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that\nthere appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore,\nWJC\'s words are so interlaced with Branch\'s recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC\nquotes was far fewer than I had expected.\nHRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with\nBranch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the\nGephardt comment, and didn\'t grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRC\'s devotion to CVC, thought\nthat there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much\naligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in\nthe book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...\nBranch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion\nof the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his\nconnection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are\nstrikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not\nappear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just weren\'t addressed. Much like My Life,\none theme that repeated itself was WJC\'s conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages\nabout NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you\nwould be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJC\'s acute allergies and his\nchronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions.\nThe book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch\ncould write that hadn\'t been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D\'Amato\'s subpoena of CVC\'s friends,\nlater quashed, who slept over while HRC\'s Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does\nportray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks\nWhitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from\nWhitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someone\'s eye, such\nas WJC referring to Paula Jones as "a \'new bimbo\' he [WJC] didn\'t even recognize."\nBranch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no\nother lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason\nhe didn\'t mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if\nshe was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a\nvery small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don\'t recall hearing this\nbefore. (This is addressed more fully below.)\nThere are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC\'s relationship\nwith Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with\nJanet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues\nare discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed\nin a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her\nrelationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.\nOn foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans,\nChina, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about\nHaiti is about Branch\'s own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion\nabout North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in\nwhat seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this\nbook.\nIn certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the\nUSSS cancelled one stop because they would be "defenseless" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets\nwould be lined with "assassins." There are candid looks at WJC\'s take on certain people and the relationship\nbetween some, such as Albright and Berger\'s dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin\'s\ndrinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza.\nOne thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders\ngoing, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC\'s\nGephardt comment.\nThe following items are addressed in the memo:\nWen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4\nWJC and Lewinsky\'s Silence 4\nHRC and Kissinger 4\nHRC and gay/lesbian 5\nTension with Moynihan 5\nHRC as World Player 5\nJesse Jackson 6\nTension with Janet Reno 6\nPortrayal of Carter 7\nRelationship with Gore 8\nOther (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC and Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap,\nSubpoenas of CVC\'s Friends, Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run\nfor Senate, Trip to South Asia) 11\nWen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill\nIn discussing Wen Ho Lee\'s release Branch characterizes WJC\'s lack of knowledge about the strained\ninterpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a "confession." My Life\nonly mentions Lee\'s accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from\nBranch\'s book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.\n➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security\nagencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his\npersonal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown,\nsolitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to\nChina or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their\ntreason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more\nthan to establish Lee\'s innocence. [Branch, 577]\n➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others "were being held in secret, uncharged\nand untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without\nforeseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the\nlegal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his\ndismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme\ndetention had last three years. \'I think it\'s wrong,\' he [WJC] said. \'It\'s not American. We accept guilty\npeople on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom.\' [Branch, 629]\nWJC and Lewinsky\'s Silence\nBranch writes that part of WJC\'s motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could\nsend her to jail, as she had denied it.\n➢ "Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of\nthe affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could\nhave turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while\noriginal, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his\nsteadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinsky\'s account." [Branch, 511]\nHRC and Kissinger\nThe following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor\nRoosevelt.\n➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he\ncomplained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn\'t be able to see his own doctor. She continued to\nsay "it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His\nvisage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because\nthe Clinton health care bill was dying. \'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,\' she replied coolly. \'Don\'t be sure that it\'s\ndead. We\'ll keep fighting, and there\'s always light at the end of the tunnel.\' She said Kissing blanched,\nspeechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary\'s dream, it registered that\nhis strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...\'That\'s what I dreamed,\'\nHillary repeated, lost in thought. \'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life.\'\n[Branch, 179]\nHRC and gay/lesbian\nWriting about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJC\'s counsel got very "exercised." WJC left\nthe room. "He was subdued on his return. \'You know, I\'ve had a lot more contact with gay people in my life\nthan Hillary.\' He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues\nwere even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take.\nOn the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation." [Branch, 551]\nTension with Moynihan\nThere are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC\'s grievances and frustration with\nMoynihan. For example:\n> When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could\nfight for themselves, Branch writes, "The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...\'That\'s just a\nfreebie for him,\' snapped Clinton, \'and he knows it.\'" [p.140]\n> In regard to health care: "Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan\nfor aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme." [p.170]\n➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: "She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a\nnumber of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was\nsure they had nothing to hide. \'Why not have an investigation?\' he often asked. She said Moynihan\nskated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny\nhimself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania\nAvenue Development Corporation." [Brach, 182]\n➢ "Donnybrook" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted\nhypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, "He doesn\'t understand...that he\'s\nconceding the principles." WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press\nand said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by "feeding the beast of hostile presumption about\nClinton\'s motives." [Branch, 299]\nHRC as World Player\nThere are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several\nexamples follow:\n➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: "They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the\nClintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a\ndelicate race between Hussein\'s failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president\nsaid he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water\ndisputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein\ngave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point." [Branch, 170]\n> South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, "Her [HRC\'s] schedule was far more\ndemanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden\nwomen." [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. "By contrast with\na superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in\nexotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for\ncitizenship groups and small-scale economic development." (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to\na NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, "she [HRC] played the traditional role of First\nLady as wife and mother...") [Branch, 246]\n> China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she\ndepicted the "harsh reality everywhere" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the\nrave reviews of HRC\'s speech. [Branch, 289]\n➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes "Yeltsin seemed so removed from\nurgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly." [Branch, 512-513]\nJesse Jackson\nBranch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact\nwith her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs\ngratitude, but the fact that Jackson "counseled" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.\n➢ "But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called\nChelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was\nanother story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in\nAmerican politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much\nher parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel,\nrage, or pray, he was always available." [Branch, 497]\nTension with Janet Reno\nThroughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative\nopinion of Janet Reno.\n> "He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney\ngeneral. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996\ncampaign finance] would fall to Reno\'s deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno\'s\nwholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a\ntarget...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest\nlike Nixon\'s Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.\nThat was not an option." [Branch, 388-389]\n> Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D\'Amato and\ncontinuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy.\nBranch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her\n"desire to stay on the job. \'I told her I didn\'t like that one damn bit,\' the president said tersely. \'I didn\'t\nhire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.\'" [Branch,\n398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including\ncoordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn\'t blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater,\nbut that "he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting\nmandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno\nhad failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension\nthe entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her\nmore naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her." [Branch, 399] He cites\nthat Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second\nterm.\nPortrayal of Jimmy Carter\nThere are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter\'s trip to\nNorth Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter\'s seeming desire to be\non the front lines.\nNorth Korea:\n➢ "On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore,\nand Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea\'s extreme\nisolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow\ninspection of North Korea\'s nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions.\nThe only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding\ngratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House\nseething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters,\nand he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy \'if the game were still in doubt.\' [Branch,\n162]\nHaiti:\n➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with\nGore (who said Carter shouldn\'t be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to\nHaiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having \'clientitis\'\n(arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States\' best interest). He\ndidn\'t want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to\nthe press first. "The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay\nover at the White House, called CNN\'s Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next\nmorning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not\nright...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent\nnegotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to\nClinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton\nfound this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he\nallowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to\nspeak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States\ngovernment complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but\nClinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-\nresident." [Branch, 200-201]\nDispatch of Bombers Near Iraq\n➢ "He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and\nBush. \'Dole will support me,\' he said. \'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he\ndoesn\'t have much positive to say." [Branch, 518]\nGore\nFor the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore\'s relationship. There are few places\nwhere he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the\nseemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.\n➢ On page 92 Branch writes, "No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as\nalleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of \'bad talkers\': shy National Security Adviser\nTony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les\nAspin." [Branch, 92]\n➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O\'Leary and also\nhaving Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other\nnations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to\nredeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC\n"pronounced them vital to Chelsea\'s schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked.\n`Al,\' Clinton told him, \'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.\' Gore\nerupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still\nwrangling about dates for Japan." Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw\nLewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]\n➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore\'s sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as\na team to secure the Cabinet for the second term.\n➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second\ncriminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is\nabout a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free.\nThe exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.\n➢ On Gore\'s announcing his campaign. "The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his\nkickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were\ntechnical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself\nfrom Clinton\'s personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House.\nThe president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton\'s affair with Monica Lewinsky \'inexcusable.\'\nFirst, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be\nbadgered to death until he did. \'Al,\' Clinton told him, \'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I\nwould let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.\'" [Branch, 553-554]\nBranch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his\ncampaign. "On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to\nGore\'s pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely\nhow and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off\nsubstance." [Branch, 554]\n➢ WJC offered critiques of Gore\'s campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not\nsucceeding him. For example, "Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart,\nexperience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential\ncharacter over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore "stiff," but Clinton discounted\nthis liability. He thought Gore\'s droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was\nperceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to\nemphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding\nquality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature\nfailed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word "sunny." Gore needed more of it." [Branch, 599]\n➢ He also complimented Gore\'s knowledge of government workings. "Gore knew Washington. Believe\nme, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had\nit not been for the vice president." He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who\nwould be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into\ngreat detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this\nwas WJC\'s emphasis versus Branch\'s focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]\n➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. "They should be running\nessentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would\ntarnish them with Clinton\'s character." [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC\'s critique of Gore in debate\nthat had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch.\n➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where "Gore had bared himself in one\nof their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he\nmeant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend\nthe two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He\nhad the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow\nwithout seeming to brag on his own record." [Branch, 623-624]\n➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure\nat first about recording the details. At the outset it says, "For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did\nhe blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him\ndid." [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gore\'s use of him was proper—he was best in the\nWhite House. Then he says, "\'I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,\'"\nClinton told Gore, \'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message,\nnow that we\'re being honest.\'" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that\n"Clinton\'s drag plagued every direction." Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than\nClinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an "unparalleled" vice\npresident, but that he had "blind spots." Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was\n"surreal."\no Gore had a "fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising\nscandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal\nintegrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said\nhe had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that\nhe found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the\npresident was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for\ntrouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the\nensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. \'I thought\nhe was in Neverland,\' he said." [Branch, 643-644]\no Branch continues: "The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported\nClinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself\ndisappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did\nnot confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to\nsay, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake.\nHe had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis.\nWell, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double\ntake...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of\nthem angry. Clinton exploded that Gore\'s reaction was phony. What was so significant\nhere?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed\nhonesty that somehow cost the election. Clinton\'s character was at the root of it..." [Branch,\n644-45]\nOther\n➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch\'s book, it has WJC asking\nMaggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLarty\'s replacement. "Williams was shrewd, discreet,\nand efficient." [Branch, 161]\n> HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team\'s\nsuggestion to invade Haiti. "He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the\npressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign\npolicy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake,\nBerger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray\nInman as defense secretary." [Branch, 189]\n> ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book.\nQuinn said that HRC had denied credit to the book\'s collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn.\nHRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft\nchapters in HRC\'s handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a\nghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female\nveterinarian of Socks\' were "discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House." [Branch,\n342-343]\n> Subpoenas of CVC\'s Friends: Branch tells of how D\'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had\nsubpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRC\'s Rose firm records were\nthere. This included "some two dozen of Chelsea\'s sleepovers." Senator Sarbanes quashed the\nsubpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]\n➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, "In our\nglancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as\nlighthearted or recreational." [Branch, 495]\n> Gore/HRC ticket: "By the numbers, and Clinton\'s gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their\nbest chance to defeat Bush for the White House. \'Hands down,\' he [WJC] said, tut I don\'t think Al\nwould ever do it.\'" [Branch, 540]\n> WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting\nHRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the\ntwo events are unconnected. "When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the\nNew York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."\n[Branch, 557]\n➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because "of hard\nintelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins." [Branch, 594] My Life discusses\nthe cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.\nDI \'Gephardt is an asshole," Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She\nwinced but shrugged with a smile. "Well, he is," she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first\nlady\'s epithet." [Branch, 263]',)
('I\'ve attached the gorgeous cover as a PDF\nHillary\'s Moment: Clinton Faces the World\nBy Joe Klein\nTime Magazine\nWednesday, Nov. 04, 2009\nIt was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. "We\'re prepared to start\npeace talks immediately," the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton standing at his side, poker-faced. "I think we should ... get on it and get with it."\nIt was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their\nleader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West\nBank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a\npartial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was\na nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an "unprecedented" offer,\nNetanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)\nIt was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had\nsoftened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli\n"restraint" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration\'s retreat, agreeing that\nNetanyahu\'s proposal was, indeed, "unprecedented," even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most\nimportant thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the\nPalestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration\'s retreat. Their Arab\nneighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan "falls far short" of\nU.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it "unprecedented," which was neither diplomatic nor wise.\nSuddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on\nNetanyahu\'s proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,\nprivately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration\'s mission was to get the parties into peace talks\nwithout preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton\nhad violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright.)\nClinton\'s Three Qualities\nFor the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go\nto Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there "guardedly optimistic" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the\nIsraelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The\nbreakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he\'d be willing to go to\nJerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone\'s surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and\nreach what appears to be a breakthrough — they\'re talking! — which then becomes another dead end.\nThe job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,\nis still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,\ndiplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the\nNational Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton\'s recent predecessors have\ndistinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was\nRichard Nixon\'s schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James\nBaker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush\'s best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have\nbeen frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we\'re talking about — the second most popular American in\nthe world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking\nheadline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.\nIt is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The\nconventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton\'s\nreticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the\nheavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she\nbecomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration\'s policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.\nColin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the\nObama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum\nlooms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?\nTraditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the\nstriped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign\nindicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian\nidealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem\nindicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.\nThere are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of\ndepartmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy\n— that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the\noffice since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand\nand interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an\ninternational celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to\nthe President\'s — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.\nShe has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although\nher performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed\ntentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,\nClinton\'s cautious formality took a backseat to Gates\' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems\nfar more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton\'s\ncampaign.)\nIndependence and Candor\nIn the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the\nbehest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.\nIn the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her\nindependence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after\nan opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — "Can\'t we all just get along?" — phase.\nDuring her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been\nunprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan\nspecialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had\nbeen bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan\'s moderate Islamic majority. "We\nsaw her praying there," an academic named Shala Aziz told me, "and, for the first time, I\'m thinking, The Americans have\nhearts."(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)\nThe big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts\nand Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the\nPakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press\naccounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State\'s getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton\'s\nundiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,\nhad begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the\nPakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast\nwas especially sharp after George W. Bush\'s eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez\nMusharraf. "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home," said Farahnaz\nIspahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. "Clinton\'s willingness to meet with everyone, hostile\nor not, has made a big impression — and because she\'s Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it\nmeans so much more."\nTransformative Experience\nThere are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and\nClinton\'s — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional.\nEarlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album\nof photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and\ndaughter Chelsea. "It did bring tears to my eyes," Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,\n"because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..." She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,\ntalking about the "reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all."\nClinton\'s first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I\nbelieve, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when\nwe set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994\ncongressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very\npersonal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.\nPrivately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was\nChelsea\'s spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy\nczar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously\nridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs.\n"That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable," Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her\nJerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing\nglasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. "I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I\'ve\ndone since," she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.\nConference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: "Women\'s rights are human\nrights."(See photos of Beijing\'s changing skyline.)\nClinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years\nof insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.\nWhen her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside\nBhutto\'s hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. "She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar\nkameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did\nanything like that," Clinton says.\nWhen Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because\nBhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking\nBhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, "I used to be able\nto walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can\'t." When I asked her why, she said — bluntly —\n"The Saudis," who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto\'s acquiescence to, and\nparticipation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so\ninadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto\'s assassination in 2007.)\nIronically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton\'s interests — microfinance, education and\nhealth care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State\nDepartment but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones -\nschools, justice, economic development — reinforce the military\'s efforts to secure the population. As a result, there\nwas immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army\'s counterinsurgency\nmanual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At\none point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential\nDemocratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, "You mean, aside from Hillary?"\nIt was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke ("my two alpha males," she calls them) for the first time -\nat her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the\nmilitary while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than\nusual — although Defense Secretary Gates\' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn\'t hurt. In\nfact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton\'s relationship with the White House staff.\nClinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID\ndirector, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. "It was all sorts of niggling things," says a Clinton adviser, "like, Farmer had\nat one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the\namount was illegal."\nAnother of Clinton\'s military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, "I\'m a Republican. I disagree with her\nabout practically everything, but she\'d make a hell of a Commander in Chief." There is a palpable toughness to the\nwoman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President\'s instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest\nexchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the "bluster" of George W. Bush\nafter she said the U.S. would be able to "obliterate" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton\'s edgier tone\nhas been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli\nsettlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted "to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not\noutposts, not natural-growth exceptions." And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a\nrhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read "Clinton\'s Collateral Damage.")\nThe White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps\nremoved from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:\nwhenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of\nthe room. Despite Netanyahu\'s momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the\nde facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.\nHillary\'s Choice\nThe tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in\nsubstantive agreement on the President\'s diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is\nwilling to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;\nneither Obama\'s gauziness nor Clinton\'s inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing\nperception that the Administration\'s policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems\nready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there\'s no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain\nrecalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on\nhuman rights with no apparent quid pro quos.\nThe White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will\nreturn to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for "strategic patience." But the only thing Obama\nreally has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have\nrefrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force -\nthe Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda\'s leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this\nAdministration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesn\'t happen\novernight, but for Obama\'s policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be\nexplained to the public.\nThere is also a growing sense that the President\'s inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which\nrepresents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but\nin his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace\nhunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran\'s Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;\nif it doesn\'t, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is\naccompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. "You can\'t be seen pushing countries around — demanding\n[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results," says Leslie\nH. Gelb, author of Power Rules. "The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they\'ll begin to take\nyou less seriously." (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)\nClinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise\nfor the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also\nburblings and emanations from Clinton\'s staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for\nthe Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the\nuncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton\'s occasional overseas gaffes.\nThese tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that\nthe Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New\nYork, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,\nthough, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President\'s\nprimary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials\nhave spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. "Either\nyou have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President," says a former\nRepublican Secretary of State, "or there is no message."(See photos from eight months of Obama\'s diplomacy.)\nAides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton\'s staff acknowledged\nthat she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television\nis a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely\nguarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President\'s alter ego\non foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama\'s national-security team is Gates — but he\'s a\nRepublican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones\nhas settled in as National Security Adviser, but he\'s not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign\npolicy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.\nClinton\'s value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning\nthe $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. "How much damage control\nhave you been able to do on this trip?" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton\'s\nmeeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. "I don\'t know," she\nsaid. "I hope some."\nAfterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. "Well, this trip was long overdue," she said. "The Pakistani\npeople really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone\nattacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the\ndamage control" — she paused, thinking it through — "I\'d have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot."\nIn the end, though, Clinton\'s success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.\nShe will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who\nknows where he wants to go in the world but hasn\'t quite figured out how to get there.',)

('sbwhoeop\nTuesday, February 16, 2010 8:40 AM\nH: FYI: Les Gelb. S\nReplace Rahm\nby Leslie H. Gelb\nFebruary 15, 2010 I 10:48pm\nI ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to\nsave his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid\nof National Security adviser Jim Jones.\nThe negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must\nchange key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It\'s mostly a\nmatter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven\nrecords of getting things done in Washington and the world.\nTo be fair, it\'s not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or\nhis White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far\nbeyond their experience in that realm. Unless you\'re there, you don\'t know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except\nfor the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who\'s got to be helped. So\nit is they who\'ve got to go.\nIt is he who\'s got to be helped. So it is they who\'ve got to go.\nOne may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it\'s hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and\nespecially in Washington—that doesn\'t descend into ripping Obama\'s White House team. The refrain of complaints is\nalways the same:\n• Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not "begrudge" Wall\nStreeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of\nweeks ago that such big bonuses were "shameful."\n• Obama doesn\'t know what\'s really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that "I think it is absolutely true\nthat what we did this year didn\'t produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of\nthese political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high." He had to be totally out of it\nnot to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing.\n• Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesn\'t recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know\nhow to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he\nis "an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don\'t see any common\nground and believe the administration has to "scrap the bill and start over."\n• It\'s even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a "war of necessity" and orders more than 30,000\nnew troops there, coupled with an announcement that he\'ll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see\nsome of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won\'t.\nI\'ve scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce\nprovided a thunderclap on Washington\'s negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna\'s Chicago-laden team.\nLuce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story.\nThey were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially\neridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers\' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as\nit was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody\nPowell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And\nthey were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the "them" versus "us" (Washington insiders and\nbureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations.\nThe Chicagoans and others "guarding" the president create their own "us versus them" world. It\'s hard to imagine a policy\nconversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington\nor policy experience. And there isn\'t much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president\non a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team.\nHere are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief\nof staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I\'ve talked to believes he has the management skills and\ndiscipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the\ntime to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University\nof North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well\nunder Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former\nClinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage.\nReplace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House\'s National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former\nchairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he\'s been beaten up and is said to want\nout anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a\nposition to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama\'s weekly gyrations. Others with\nproven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer,\nVincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in\nWashington who\'d improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all\nwould help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and\npolicy head.\nDavid Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign,\nwherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice.\nGood replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the\nformer Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial\nresidence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago\nbuddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making\npolicy.\nMr. Obama\'s crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It\'s nice, but not nearly\nenough.\nRobert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let\'s put it this way: He wasn\'t born for daily jousts with pithy\nRepublicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible\nsuccessors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York\nTimes.\nLast but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired\nand respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO\'s military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by\nwide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement\nof this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise\nplans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is\nZbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter\'s national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and\nknows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig\'s lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia.\nAlso available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the\nNational Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former\nambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They\nhave it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on\nstrategy.\nYes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all\npossess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical\nbonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or\nthree years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as\nintellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in\nsensing what\'s achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make\nadjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small\nas well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed.\nLeslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of powerRule,5-.

("sbwhoeor\nSunday, November 29, 2009 1:0S PM\nH\nRe: Another memo on backdrop to this week. Sid\nNovember 28, 2009\nEditorial\nDiplomacy 101\nWe were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled\nspecial envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel\nviolence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel.\nNine months later, the president's promising peace initiative has unraveled.\nThe Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they won't talk to the Israelis until they do, and\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything.\nMr. Obama's own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be\nfarther off than ever.\nPeacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one\nmove down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israel's\ncommitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nsaid no.\nMost important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace\ntalks. (We don't know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political\nadvisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.)\nThe idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start\nnegotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down.\nMr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and\npermits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond\nwhat past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the\ncompromise.\nWashington isn't the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially\nSaudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel\nto fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr.\nAbbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel.\nAll this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic\nperformance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks?\nThe president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence\nof a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way\nforward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.",)

Egypt and\nJordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would\nseek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would\npresent its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties\' positions. Deputy\nEnvoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference\n(he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role.

No longer.\n"Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean."\nThe inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integrating\nSteinberg\'s portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts in\nconcert.\n"Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretary\'s team, but we haven\'t always shown how crucial he is to State\'s\nmission," said Philippe Reines, Clinton\'s communications consiglieri. "This is a one simple way to fix that."\nThe Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn\'t happy, or that he\'s not seen as an integral part of\nPresident Obama\'s foreign policy team, or that his efforts aren\'t appreciated.\nReines, who rarely speaks on the record, responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in this\nway: "I\'m not a shrink, and I have to confess that we don\'t sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. But\nwhat is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart, dedicated, and valued."\nSteinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration\'s team lead, cybersecurity\nand China (he\'s been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran), but his work often goes\nunnoticed.\nOn Friday, he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, about that\ncountry\'s actions during a visit by Vice President Biden.\nWhen President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser, he asked Clinton to make Steinberg her\ndeputy -- and she did. Since day one, prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clinton,\nalthough none has publicly surfaced.',)

But TNR is only one key being hit in the Wurlitzer. Here\'s one small but\nfrank thing: Axelrod should not be a foreign policy spokesman on any issue or area.

March 16, 2010 17:13 pm\nJERUSALEM—Suddenly, my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005, life in\nJerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting from\nconstruction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near the\ngates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching with\ngreen Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this city\'s ultimate\nnightmare.\nThe return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process\nin the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such\nannouncements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded,\nlet alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewish\nneighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods of\nFrench Hill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike the\nSnail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the established\nJewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus.\nWhy, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness "day of rage" over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authority\'s call\nto gather on the Temple Mount to "save" the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Why\nthe sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old City\'s Jewish Quarter,\nwhen dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident?\nThe answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East\nJerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no\nless.\nAstonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the\nlast year. Though Oben-la\'s insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step\ntoo far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish\nneighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze\nthere. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that\nPalestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly.\nObama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though\nPalestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit\ndown with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obama\'s demand for a building freeze\nin Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations.\nFinally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of "proximity talks"—setting\nPalestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table\nwith Israelis.\nThat Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But\nhe has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and\nelsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—he\'s ensured that the\nPalestinians won\'t show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy.\nInitially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Biden\'s\nhumiliation and were outraged at their government\'s incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu\ndeserved the administration\'s condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didn\'t do: He failed to\nconvey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Biden\'s visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of\ngoverning generally.\nBut not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir,\nthe former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of\nthe creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on\nthe Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. That\'s why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and\nwhy he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the\nmainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden\nduring his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.\nNor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry\nthat oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party.\nIts interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international\nincidents is not its style.\nFinally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered\nby Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the\ninterior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit.\nIn turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight\nwith Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so.\nAc.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Ma\'ariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obama\'s goal is to topple the\nNetanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition.\nThe popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his\nineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is\nnot likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis\' initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an\nIsrael Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent\nblame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) •\nIn the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though\nthe Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews\' historic roots\nin Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a\nterrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didn\'t merit an administration rebuke.\nObama\'s one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of "open season" against Israel\ninternationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the\nresumption of the peace process—as if it\'s Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table.\nIf the administration\'s main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main\nstrategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm\nEmanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obama\'s first tent.\ninstead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel\nnegotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if\nIsraelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them.\nTo insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Biden\'s plea to Israelis to consider a\nwithdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer\ntwice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and\nthen more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never\nreplied.\nThe reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the\nreturn of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution\nfrom devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israel\'s insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace.\nTo achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa\nand Jaffa and confine their people\'s right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their\nclaim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their people\'s right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible\ndeal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of\nIsraelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has\nrejected it.\nIn the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two-\nstate solution but on more limited goals.\nThere have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created\npanic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of\nSalem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still\nlacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israel\'s removal of dozens of\nroadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends.\nBut by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace\nprocess, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process.\nThe administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious\naccusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are\nendangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the\nremark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obama\'s recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian--\nlives.

('sbwhoeop\nSaturday, March 20, 2010 5:54 PM\nH: fyi. sid\nH: Uri Avnery, the Israeli analyst and activist, is privately circulating this analysis today. One consequence: Petraeus\ncannot run as a Republican. At least Putin didn\'t bring his big dogs in with him like he did with Merkel. Cheers, Sid\nUri Avnery\n20.3.10\nThe Doomsday Weapon\nIT IS already a commonplace to say that people who don\'t learn from history are condemned\nto repeat their mistakes.\nSome 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the\nRoman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and\ninsignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against the\nrival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What\nchances could the Jewish revolt have?\nGod knows what was going on in the mind of the "Zealots". They eliminated the moderate\nleaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish\npopulation of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Rome\nand believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps\nthey had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall.\nWe know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the\ntemple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada.\nThe Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke\nthe great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted\ncompromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. They\ncleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole\nworld.\nBut since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of\nMasada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in public\ndiscourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots.\nThe next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the\nnew Rome.\nWHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into\nsomething far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant.\nLately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama\nwith thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term\nhave dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for a\nreal settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining.\nYet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his\nsenior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of\nState Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity,\nEast Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict,\nincluding East Jerusalem, and more.\nThe surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian\narmy had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the\nreserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations in\nthe US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its\nsoldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House.\nIt seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama\nwould be defeated.\nAnd then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon.\nTHE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind.\nDavid Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general,\nson of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis,\nstood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a "distinguished cadet", in Army\nCommand and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped\nplaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as\nan assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy.\nHe made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical\ncity in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win\nover the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money than\nammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstanding\nthat his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army.\nHis star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon\nbecame the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East\n, except Israel and Palestine (which "belong" to the American command in Europe).\nWhen such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military\nthinker, he has no rivals.\nTHIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his\nAOR (Area Of Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran,\nIraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the "root causes of instability" in the region. The\nlist was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIn his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: "The enduring hostilities between\nIsrael and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our\ninterests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of\nU.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and\ndepth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the\nlegitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant\ngroups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the\nArab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas."\nNot content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs\nof Staff,\nIn other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a\nsupreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided\nsupport for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution.\nThe argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past.\n(Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would\nchange its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official document\nwritten by the responsible American commander.\nThe Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its\nspokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesn\'t\nunderstand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people in\nJerusalem break out into cold sweat.\nAS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits\n— almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest\ndeviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide.\nBut in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles\' heel, the immense\nmight of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its\npower.\nIt was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive\nintelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his\nduty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered the\nlives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to\nimpose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of\nsuccessive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his\nintelligence chiefs in this matter.\nBut the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock\nHolmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish\ncommunity fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard.\nWhy? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for the\ngovernment of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the\nsecurity of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans,\nsnap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their\nheads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel\nahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the\nmantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical.\nAnd now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The\npolicy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq\nand Afghanistan.\nFOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been\nwidely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews have\nstarted to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake.\nThis week, Netanyahu\'s brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that\nObama is an "anti-Semite". The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama\nis really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and in\nwriting that "Hussein" Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming\ncongressional elections and in the next presidential ones.\n(Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from\nconvinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obama\'s treatment of Israel is\nfair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.)\nIf Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israel\nputs the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequences\nfor Israel.\nFor the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship in\norder to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the\n•present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long as\nthe present coalition in Israel stays in power.\nWhen the movie "Hurt Locker" won its awards, the entire American public was united in its\nconcern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced\nthat Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for\nhim.',)

It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the "final status" issues, as they\'re\noften called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure.\nThis devotion to "constructive ambiguity" has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40\nyears. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable\nsettlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the "right of return" to\nIsrael -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later.\nBut the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du\n..ripq. visit ily__Vde President\nBiden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in ,lerusal.\nerp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it\nmildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a "deeply negative signal" about U.S.-Israeli\nrelations and "an insult."\nIn the ensuing hubbub over the "crisis" in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a\nmisunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that\'s a mistake.\nThe East Jerusalem move wasn\'t an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right\'s rejection of\nconcessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz\nthe issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry,\nbasically called his bluff.\n"Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do," said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli\nambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded:\n"Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?"\nSo what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best\nefforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats?\nThe administration\'s best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that\nmust frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national\nsecurity adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual\nadjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past\nfour decades has converged toward those parameters.\nThe Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its\npeacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this "big bang" made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones,\nthe national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the\nNorthern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging\nproposals.\nRather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on\nsettlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama\'s first months in office, confident that he\nwas so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly\nbided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally\nagreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration\nshould have seen what was coming.\nIn retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved\ndestructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without\nmaking concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle.\nJerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers\nhave wanted to save it for last. But this month\'s crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible.

('Below is the article I mentioned:\nU.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms\nWashington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran\'s Thunder at U.N. Conference\nBy JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA\nThe U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks\nto prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday.\nU.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some\nfor its silence about Israel\'s undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as\nIran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program.\nWashington also reassured Israel it won\'t foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant\nprogress has been made on Mideast peace.\nThe U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a\nbang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal\nto disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel\'s nuclear capability.\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon.\nThe U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have\nbeen pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran\'s program.\n"The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party," said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The\nofficial highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues.\nThe designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged\nfrom a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995\nagreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken\nsince.\nSenior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear\nweapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt\nwould resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and\nTurkey.\n"We\'ve made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before," said the senior\nU.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy.\nU.S. officials stressed, however, that they didn\'t believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in\nArab-Israeli peace talks.\n"We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely\nunless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted," said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms\ncontrol and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members\nof the Nonaligned Movement.\nThe diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N.\nconference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security\nconference in Washington in March due to such concerns.\nAn Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that\n"it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the\ncountries in the region."\nThe U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obama\'s calls for a complete freeze in building new\nJewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that\nties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track\nnext week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration\nwants to see.\nEgypt\'s latest proposal calls for Israel\'s disarmament "as soon as possible." It also called for Israel\'s nuclear program to be\nplaced under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.\'s atomic watchdog. That proposal won\'t\nbe accepted, U.S. officials said.\nThe Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release "all information available to them on the nature and\nscope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel."\nU.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel.\nArms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of\ncalling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone.\n"They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections," said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation\nEducation Center and a critic of the Obama administration\'s arms-control approach.\nDaryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a\nspecial envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was\npart of the U.S. offer.\nThe last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this\nconference for nearly a year.\nThe White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesn\'t escape inspections and\nsanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help\nnations develop peaceful nuclear power.\nWrite to Jonathan Weisman at jonathan.weisman@wsj.com, Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Joe Lauria at\nnewseditor@wsj.com',)

('sbwhoeop\nThursday, March 25, 2010 10:16 AM\nH: Haaretz chief columnist on Bibi\'s visit. Sid\nhtto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html\nAluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker\nBy Ake Berm\nDetails emerging from Benjamin Netanyahu\'s visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless\nbe drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence-\nmending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only\nhighlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations.\nThe prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came.\nInstead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue\naside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over\nEast Jerusalem.\nAdvertisement\nThe most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of\nthe peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer.\nAt the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at\nwhich he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem.\nTaking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people\nitself and its millennia of history.\nHis speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish\nWest Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley.\nBut at the White House, the prime minister\'s speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering\ncongressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president.\nKnowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the\nweekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden\'s trip here two weeks ago, and\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahu\'s response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him\nas "useful."\nSpecial envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime minister\'s bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the\nWhite House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice.\nFar from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a\ndressing down.\nThis time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal\nanswers to the Americans\' questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that\nshould they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year.\nHis arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call\nthe next few steps of the diplomatic dance.\nBut then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had\nsent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was\ntreated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call.\nThe revolution in the Americans\' behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to\nthe House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with\ncongressmen over ties with Israel.\nThe moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest.\nThe Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the\nWhite House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House\nspokesman challenged Netanyahu\'s observation at AIPAC that "Jerusalem is not a settlement."\nThe Americans didn\'t even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior\nWashington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance.\nThe approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again\ncaught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such\nsurprises failed its first test.\nNetanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate\nthe planned emergency room at Ashkelon\'s Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through\nWashington.\nReturning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not\nrelent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with\nthe settlers.',)

Below the piece is a note by its writer about his sourcing that appeared on a small\nwebsite elsewhere. Also, I\'ve included an article by Max Blumenthal, who spends his time on this issue and plans to move\nto Israel for about 6-8 months to write a book.

Sid\nhttp://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto\nry\nThe Petraeus briefing: Biden\'s embarrassment\nis not the whole story\nPosted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 -\nOn Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command\n(responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of\nStaff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM\ncommander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33-\nslide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among\nArab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOM\'s mostly Arab constituency was losing\nfaith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in\nthe region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) "too old, too slow ... and\ntoo late."\nThe January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on\nwhat is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed\nfrom a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeus\'s instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders.\n"Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling," a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. "America\nwas not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding." But Petraeus wasn\'t finished: two days\nafter the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with\nIsrael, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeus\'s reason\nwas straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab\nleaders as engaged in the region\'s most troublesome conflict.\n[UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House.\n"CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did\npropose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH," the officer said via email. "GEN Petraeus was not certain what\nmight have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS."\n(UCP means "unified combatant command," like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)]\nThe Mullen briefing and Petraeus\'s request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeus\'s request that\nCENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied ("it was dead on arrival," a Pentagon officer confirms),\nthe Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue,\nsending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the\nchief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullen\'s trip\nfocused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that\nIsrael had to see its conflict with the Palestinians "in a larger, regional, context" -- as having a direct impact on America\'s\nstatus in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message.\nIsrael didn\'t. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu\ngovernment was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged\nthan Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the\nIsraeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to\nPetraeus\'s Mullen briefing: "This is starting to get dangerous for us," Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. "What you\'re doing\nhere undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it\nendangers regional peace." Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: "The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many\npeople in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel\'s actions and US policy, any decision about\nconstruction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of\nAmerican troops fighting against Islamic terrorism." The message couldn\'t be plainer: Israel\'s intransigence could cost\nAmerican lives.\nThere are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the\nIsraeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might\nreflect that Joe Biden\'s trip to Israel has forever shifted America\'s relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real\nbreak came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: America\'s\nrelationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of America\'s soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message\nnow.\nMark Perry\'s newest book is Talking To Terrorists\nhttp://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/\nMy piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as\nwell as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is\nthere any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand\nCENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel.\nI won\'t name my sources, even though it\'s clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who\nthey are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the\nbriefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullen\'s primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the\nreader to determine. The account is not only accurate, it\'s a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to\nit. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: it\'s true.\nIs there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing?\nI have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is\nthe authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I\nhave never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General\nPetraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance\ntheir own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country\nand he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of\nGeneral Petraeus\'s loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East.\nIt is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of "the Biden crisis" that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into\nwhether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israel\'s security. This isn\'t about Israel\'s security, it\'s about\nour security.\nhttp://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and-\nnetanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/\nNetanyahu and Pastor Hagee\'s Lovefest on Eve of Biden\'s\nArrival in Israel\nOn 03.09.10, By Max\n(Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.)\nVice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the\nconstruction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Biden\'s mission to\nhelp jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his\nplans by Netanyahu\'s appearance with John Hagee.\nThe day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day\nbefore Biden\'s arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagee\'s\nNight To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministry\'s millions in donations to\nIsraeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israel\'s perceived enemies.\nAt the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad "the Hitler of the Middle East" and denounced\nthe Goldstone Report as "character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee."\nNetanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as "the undivided,\neternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, "I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!" He used the rest of\nhis speech to call for "tough, biting sanctions" against Iran that "bite deep into its energy sector."\nHagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage:\nr--\nX\nIn the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor\nNir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal\nWest Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive\nbillionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional\ndelegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street.\nPart One of Hagee\'s speech:\nX\nPart Two.\nX\nPastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo.\nHagee\'s ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that\ntotaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and\nShomron, which was involved in promoting an "Obama Hilltop project" that promoted more settlement building and\ncompared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from\nGush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israel\'s assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel\ngovernment to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region.\nWho is Hagee funding in Israel?\nX\nWho Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo.\nThe most notable of Hagee\'s funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this\ngroup appeared in the film to thank Hagee for "help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path\nof Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity." Another student called for "the second revolution in Israel."\nIn February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi\nChazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel\nFund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report.\nThe smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli\nhuman rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a\ncolumnist for Ha\'aretz, called Im Tirtzu "a McCarthyite movement" for its attacks on Chazan.\nAlthough CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzu\'s campaign, the organization\'s appearance during CUFI\'s\nJerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future.\nRepublican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after\nHagee\'s statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that\nhe believed the anti-Christ was "partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler." However, none of Hagee\'s comments have\ndeterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity.\nDuring Hagee\'s speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of\ndifficulties between the US and Israel. "The settlements are not the problem," he boomed from the podium. "The problem\nis the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East."\nHagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he\nproclaimed, "World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in\nthe city of Jerusalem. They don\'t have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot\nlive there."\nThe following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from\nthe Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw "a moment of real opportunity."',)
("Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a\ncall.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:\nThe Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the\ncivilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet\nreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons\nsmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the\nreunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council\nresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and\ninternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of\nthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.\nConsistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as\nconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in\nGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet\nnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the\neffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards\nmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and\ninfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work\nwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as\nquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in\nconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will\nactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and\npromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.\nThe Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local\nnon-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully\nenable this work.\nThe Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes\nefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The\nQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and\nammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their\ncargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for\nunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.\nThe Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his\ncapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.\nThe Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct\nbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these\nnegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation\nwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the\nWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.",)

Unlike his\npredecessor Richard Nixon, who turned to Henry Kissinger for\nadvice, the US president has no big foreign policy strategist\nrouted through the Oval Office."\nFifteen months after he took office, the character and structure of Mr Obama\'s foreign policy machinery is still evolving.\nBut from interviews with dozens of insiders and outsiders, including senior officials both authorised and unauthorised to\nspeak, and three former national security advisers, it is clear the buck not only stops with, but often floats for quite a long\ntime around, Mr Obama himself.\nForeigners have complained about the tendency of his domestic agenda to crowd out the international one — the passage\nlast week of healthcare reform was greeted with an audible sigh of relief among US allies. But within foreign policy itself,\nhis centralised structure can also result in many issues being left on the back burner awaiting presidential attention, say\ncritics.\n"On the positive side, we have a very conscientious president who takes advice widely," says the official. "On the debit\nside, for all the president\'s intelligence, Barack Obama came to office with very little experience. He just doesn\'t have\nmuch depth on some issues.\'\nThe core of Mr Obama\'s foreign policy machinery is in the White House-based National Security Council, which advises\nthe president and co-ordinates activities across an increasingly complex alphabet soup of Washington departments,\nmilitary commands and intelligence agencies. The most widely questioned link in the chain is Jim Jones, whom, to many\npeople\'s surprise, Mr Obama brought in as his national security adviser.\nOnly briefly acquainted with Mr Obama beforehand, General Jones, a retired four-star marine corps general, shows little\ninterest in running the "inter-agency" process — a key part of the job. Somewhat unconventionally, Gen Jones travels\nfrequently and is thus often out of town. Unusually, it is Mr Obama himself who usually chairs the weekly National Security\nCouncil, known as the "principals meeting", not Gen Jones.\nRahm Emanuel, Mr Obama\'s chief of staff, is also a key part of it. "If you were to ask me who the real national security\nadviser is, I would say there were three or four, of whom Rehm is one and of which Gen Jones is probably the least\nimportant," says another official.\nAnyone who has dealt with Gen Jones speaks highly of his matter-of-factness, his geniality and the respect many foreign\ngovernments have for him — Pakistan and Israel among them. But as he himself admitted rather disarmingly last year, he\ndoes not have a taste for bureaucracy. Speaking at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank where he previously worked, Gen\nJones provoked laughter when he said: "I fondly remember [the Atlantic Council] as a place where people actually did\nwhat you asked them to do. In my new role I\'m finding out that an order is a basis for negotiation."\nThe lack of a strong national security adviser has created recurring difficulties. Perhaps the best example is the Arab-\nIsraeli peace process, which Mr Obama launched on his second day in office when he appointed Geproe Mitphspil as his\nenvoy. Three months later, Mr Obama insisted Benjamin Netanyahu freeze all settlements activity in order to boost Arab\nconfidence in the talks.\nIn a heated ;34.16NA(dpyin the ,Clvg\nli..0f7;ce. last May, in which Mr Netanyahu refused to accede to Mr Obama\'s demand, the\nonly officials present were Mr Emanuel and David Axelrod, senior adviser to Mr Obama in office and during the campaign.\nGen Jones was not there. The fallout put the talks in abeyance and damped high Arab hopes for Mr Obama.\n"The question is, which bright spark advised the president to demand a settlements freeze without working out what the\nnext step should be when Netanyahu inevitably said \'No\'?" says Leslie Gelb, an official in the Carter administration and\nformer head of the Council on Foreign Relations. "Why wasn\'t George Mitchell in the room? Where was Jones?"\nMr Obama\'s character is also stamped on the inter-agency process, set up and managed by Tom Donilon, deputy\nnational security adviser. The nitty-gritty of foreign policy-making is done at these frequent "deputies\' meetings", which\ncan sometimes consume four to six hours a day.\nDescribed by one insider as "the most powerful man in the White House whose name isn\'t widely known", Mr Donilon,\nwho was an official in the Clinton administration, is the man who keeps Mr Obama\'s trains running on time. And there are\na lot of trains. Last year, Mr Donilon held 270 deputies meetings — a workload described as "clinically insane" by a former\nsenior diplomat under Bill Clinton.\nBut as time goes on, it is becoming streamlined — now taking up roughly two to three hours a day, say officials. "People\nforget that we inherited two wars, terrorism threats, and perhaps the biggest single eight-year decline [George W. Bush\'s\ntwo terms] in America\'s power and reputation in our history," says a senior official. "It took time to put in place a process\nthat could deal with the very complex decisions we had to take."\nAlso the organiser of Mr Obama\'s 9.30arn national security briefing, Mr Donilon reinstated the paper trails needed to\nprevent intra-governmental anarchy, using the model devised by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to George\nBush senior and Gerald Ford. Vice-president Joe Biden\'s team was also incorporated to prevent the kind of "parallel\nprocess" Dick Cheney used to circumvent the bureaucracy under George W. Bush.\n"If you look for the 2002 or 2003 meeting where the decision to go to war in iraq was taken, you cannot find it," says the\nsenior official. "By getting the process right, we are improving the quality of decisions."\nThe deputies\' ties go back years. For example, the families of Mr Don;Ion and Jim Steinberg, deputy secretary of state,\noften go on holiday together. Mr Donilon\'s wife, Cathy Russell, is chief of staff to Jill Biden, the vice-president\'s wife. Mr\nSteinberg\'s wife, Sherburne Abbott, is deputy to John Holdren, Mr Obama\'s chief scientific adviser.\nAll those who regularly attend, including Michele Flournoy, a senior Pentagon official, and Susan Rice, the US\nambassador to the United Nations, have known each other since at least 1993, when they started off in the Clinton\nadministration. This is just as well, since they spend half their lives together: "A lot of work gets done in that group," says\nMs Flournoy. "Sometimes it feels like shovelling coal to keep the fires going."\nThe refurbished machinery was perhaps most in evidence during the build-up to Mr Obama\'s decision in December to\nsend another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan — a journey that took four months and involved him in 40 hours of Oval\nOffice meetings.\nBut the very diligence of the process crowded out Mr Obama\'s time to focus on other crises — of which there are many.\n"Time is the most precious commodity a president has," says a former national security adviser. "On average he is only\ngoing to have 45 minutes a day for foreign policy, so you want to make sure it is well spent."\nThe widely expected departure of Gen Jones before the end of the year has also created rivalries within the engine room.\nThose who are thought to have ambitions to replace him include Mr Steinberg, Ms Rice, Mr Donilon and Denis\nMcDonough, NSC chief of staff and the foreign policy official who is personally closest to Mr Obama. Although all are\nwidely respected, none is considered a big strategic thinker in the Kissinger or Scowcroft mould.\nDescribed by Mr Gelb as Mr Obama\'s "Lord High Executioner", Mr McDonough "has appended himself to the Chicago\ncrowd", says another official. Mr McDonough\'s widely feared role highlights some of the contradictions of Mr Obama\'s\nforeign policy apparatus.\nOnce an adviser to former Senate majority leader Tom Deschle, Mr McDonough was frequently at Mr Obama\'s side\nduring the campaign. Insiders describe him as the "enforcer" and as the keeper of "message discipline", a key element of\nany campaign but something that can drastically slow the wheels of government.\n"McDonough is the guy from the campaign and the one who plays basketball with the president — they\'re very close," says\nan official. "Instead of Jim Jones telling McDonough what the president thinks, it is the other way round."\nIndeed, if Mr Obama\'s highly centralised foreign policy machine had a face, it would be Mr McDonough\'s. "Donilon has\nbeen perceived to make the process inclusive and give everyone a seat at the table," says David Rothkopf, a former\nClinton official and scholar on the NSC. "Fairly or not, McDonough has been perceived as representing a process that\nwas taking place in another room, among the inner circle, at a table to which most weren\'t invited."\nMr Obama has built a machine in which all roads lead to and from him. On the minus side, that means a lot of lower-level\nmeetings without decisions. It also means neglecting issues that cannot be squeezed into his diary, such as trade policy,\nwhich continues to drift; or relations with India, which are unnecessarily tense.\nAnd it means that the fingerprints of Mr Obama\'s political inner circle are detected by the rumour mill even when they are\nabsent, such as on the president\'s decision to begin the rog,,g: witsirawal from anistan. in July 2011 — a\nrecommendation that came from Robert Gates, secretary of defence.\nOn the plus side. Mr Obama has a sharp learning curve, which means his administration continues to evolve. On the plus\nside also, if it has to be White House-centric, it is perhaps better with him as the Sun King than, say, Nixon or George W.\nBush.\n"At the end of each meeting, the president summarises what everyone has said and the arguments each has made with a\nreal lawyer\'s clarity," says a participant to the NSC principals meeting, which includes Mr Gates and Mrs Clinton. "When\nthe president finally makes a decision, it is with the full facts and usually shows a high calibre of judgment."\nWhen Mr Obama makes a decision, that is.\nSTATE AND DEFENCE DEPARTMENTS\nAn \'alliance of the unsackables\' finds it can confront the inner circle\nIf there is a caveat to the depiction of the Obama administration as White House-centric, it is in the\nalliance between Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, the president\'s secretaries of state and defence.\nMrs Clinton has proved one of the surprises of Barack Obama\'s tenure, forging a strong working\nrelationship with her former rival and establishing herself as his chief foreign policy spokesperson\ninternationally — if not at home, where Mr Obama\'s inner circle often seems to monopolise the explaining.\nMr Gates, who recently decided to stay for at least another year, is seen as unsackable, not least for the\ncredibility he lends on issues ranging from missile defence to Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan. As a\nholdover from the Bush administration, his national security bona fides are hard to dispute. It is no\ncoincidence that Mrs Clinton is probably the only other unsackable cabinet member.\nThe combination has made itself felt in some of the administration\'s most significant debates, notably on\nAfghanistan, where both successfully urged the deployment of more troops.\n"Gates and Clinton happen to like each other, which no one really predicted," says one official, who notes\nthat while the traditional role of the NSC is to "play referee" between the state and defence departments,\nit is as often nowadays a combination of the two against the White House. This is very different from how\nit worked when Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell held those positions.\n"We work together well," Mr Gates said at an appearance with Mrs Clinton on CNN last year. "I think it\nstarts with, frankly, based on my experience, the secretary of defence being willing to acknowledge that\nthe secretary of state is the principal spokesperson for United States foreign policy."\nTheir outlooks often overlap. From the Pentagon, Mr Gates has long called for more US spending on\ndiplomacy. As chief diplomat, Mrs Clinton has adopted a muscular approach. On Iran, both favour tough\nsanctions; on Russia, both have sought to reassure Moscow\'s neighbours even while improving relations\nwith the Kremlin.\nBut for all their workmanlike co-operation, there is no escaping the fact that Mrs Clinton is not part of the\nObama inner circle — a traditionally helpful feature in that job. There is also a constant "residue of friction"\nbetween Mr Obama\'s and Mrs Clinton\'s teams, according to insiders. For example, Cheryl Mills, Mrs\nClinton\'s chief of staff, has had several run-ins with others in the administration.\nOne official describes Mrs Clinton as "totally loyal" to Mr Obama. He adds: "She and the president are not\nthe best of friends — how could they be? But she totally respects the presidency — she was married to a\npresident and she wanted to be one ... She still might be."\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2010. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

"Let\'s\nget rid of the freeze and get back to building," declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on\nIsrael National Radio yesterday. "It\'s our land anyway!" (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel).\nBack in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington\nPost\'s op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that "there were zero building starts in the West\nBank settlements."\nDuring the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document\nnew settlement construction and the settlers\' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har\nHoma, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing\nconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham.\n0\nNetanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he\nannounced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false\ndistinction between the West Bank and "parts of Jerusalem" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli\ngovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, "We\'ve made a clear distinction between the West Bank and\nJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such." With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go\nforward.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Obama\'s meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring\nJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post\'s Anne Kornblut reported,\n"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a\nmoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September." This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was\nonly an illusion after all.',)
('Are the Mideast Policy Team!\nby Leslie H. Gelb\nJuly 7, 2010 I 2:38pm\nI ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval\nOffice of the White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obama\'s bow to Netanyahu was\njust the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb on who\'s to\nblame—and how the White House can get back on course.\nWhoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experience\nin dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks.\nAnd whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on Tuesday should also be fired. The\nonly thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for\nthe rest of Obama\'s first term.\nThe real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it\'s failure.\nWere the culprits the non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho David\nAxelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George\nMitchell, the president\'s Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, he\'s had enough experience\nworking with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of\ncourse, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israel\'s constituents in\nAmerica, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro-\nArab contingent of the State Department?\n•Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace\n•Peter Beinart: Netanyahu\'s Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we\nfind out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter\neggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. He\'s the expert. He\'s the decider. He invites everyone to state\nhis or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding.\nMr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the\nMiddle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding\nthat Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians.\nAnyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu\nagreeing to this "proposal" were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning\nnegotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking?\nAnd yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they\nwould start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant\nand stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with\nit. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr.\nNetanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli\nprime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldn\'t shake his hand when he departed. There\'s\nno surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader\nhumiliate him.\nThis brilliant tactic — thought of by Obama\'s advisers or the president himself — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli\nbacks even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not\nabout to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular within\nconservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obama\'s support for pressing\nIsrael even in private.\nTo top this all off with Tuesday\'s meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic,\nonly made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of\n. .\nAmerican politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see\ngenuine progress in Mideast talks.\nThere is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and\nplace. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and\nwhere both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real\nshot at peace in return for their concessions.\nTo be sure, many ask at this point — How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to\nthe negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table,\nconditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British\'\npushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further\ninflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women\nto form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into\nbackers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their\nnegotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. That\'s what needs to be done between Israel and the\nPalestinians.\nWe hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is\nwhat has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think it\'s a race against the clock. Do something now\nor fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; it\'s failure. Neither Israel nor the\nPalestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual\nviolence.\nTo set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get\nthings done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them.\nLeslie H.

('sbwhoeop\nSunday, July 11, 2010 10:06 AM\nH: fyi, leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! Sid\nBelow is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Here\'s a\nsummary:\n1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza;\n2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving;\n3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla;\n4. 20% of Americans "felt support" for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure.\nFrank Luntz analyses Netanyahu\'s media performance in the flotilla affair\nThe figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the\nsituation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries.\nChannel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38\nYaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in\nthe world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him.\nNetanyahu\'s messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has\nobtained the report.\nChico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the\ninternational elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading\nAmerican political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to\ndozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the\nopinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result\nis a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israel\'s number one\npropagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu.\nNetanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.\nChico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they\nlose their audience. For example, Netanyahu\'s comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by\nmost of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of\nNetanyahu\'s Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the\npublic opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world\npublic opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept\narguments that support Israeli positions.\nEhud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis.\nNetanyahu: There\'s no shortage of food, there\'s no shortage of medicine, there\'s no shortage of other goods.\nChico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no\nhumanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israel\'s credibility in light of the images on the\ntelevision screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners\' sympathy [emphasis\nmine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in\nGaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in\nGaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israel\'s image missed the opportunity,\naccording to Luntz.\nNetanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand,\nallowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas.\nChico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahu\'s bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain\nsupport in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel\nfollowing the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only\n34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low\npercentage.',)

('Gaza: it\'s Hamas\'s move now\nHamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel\'s occupation of Palestine\n•\n•\nc) Jeremy Greenstock\no quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST\nSo it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building\nmaterials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong.\nThe UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be\nheld to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to\nprevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination?\nA commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the\nemotions behind all this.\nWhy is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for\nthe proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a\ntraumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They\nare also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida\'s ground.\nThe director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled "Illegal, inhuman. and\ninsane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010". This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel,\nthe only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to\ninternational legitimacy in its handling of this situation?\nHamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past\n17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly\nperhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza\nbombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006\nand claim to respect democracy. Let\'s test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the\nIsraeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane.\nThe unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West\nBank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct\nexperience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the\nthreat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two\nstates in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law.\nThe distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good.\nIf a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the\nblockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that\nthey could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if\nthe blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt.\nThe Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in\nthe West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a\nmuch more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political\ncomfort.\nWe are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is\nlocked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is\nconfident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated.\nBut that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today\'s\nworld, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and\nlegitimacy breeds support.\nIsrael\'s relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond\nthe west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of\nits population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for.\nI hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel\'s discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted\nmuch too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must\nunequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence —\nunderline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In\nwhoever\'s hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will.\n•This article was originally written for the Times but not published',)

('Our clips service doesn\'t have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so here\'s the long awaited FT\nprofile -you\'ll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote:\nAn FT interview with Hillary Clinton\nBy Daniel Dombey\nFT\nJune 11 2010 22:21\nThis is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed\nstreets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey\'s end; the spotlight that\nhas not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most\nexciting for a generation - had never ended.\nBut this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton\'s convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not\nSouth Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what\nthe overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might\nsuggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of\nUS leadership, one very much built around herself.\nShe\'s had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall\ntonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she\'s still greeted by a wave of raised\narms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones.\nIn the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays\nthat pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while\nBrazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a\nborn politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and\nlocal celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage.\nMost US secretaries of state wouldn\'t bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it\nto be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip -\nand she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed\nbodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a\nquarter of a million miles since taking office.\nOn this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four\ncountries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a\nshower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we\ndon\'t leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day.\nSo what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week,\ntalking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out.\n"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister\nor the foreign minister or an ambassador," she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her\nexpansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. "People now have a voice and an opinion and a\nvote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of\nleadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary."\nShe argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US\'s image in the wake of the Bush administration\n- by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a\nbattle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is\nideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the\nforeign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions -\ngo beyond that.\nIs she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? "Well, I think that is part of the job," she replies,\ntoying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. "If you are making a case for American values and\nfor American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we\nhad to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel."\nAs in S\'ao Paulo, her system is under strain - "I\'ve been fighting this all day," she says as she masks a\ncough set off by her allergies (Washington\'s cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still\nhectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State\nDepartment are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and\nunhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as "oh my gosh", even as she discusses issues of\nstate. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe\'s airspace shutdown and tells me she\'s\nbeen talking to Norway\'s foreign minister about it.\n"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it\'s chunky! I don\'t know how\nelse to describe it," she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word\n"chunky".\nClinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner\nof her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known\nless for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who\nretains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying\nfrom a room.\nHer staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state,\nand the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W.\nBush\'s right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most\nsubstantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who\nserved as secretary almost a century ago. "Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential\nstature, has set her apart," Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. "Leaders\nwant to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion."\nState visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S\'ao Paulo\nairport in March\nBack in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of\ntraditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her\ndance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous\nyoung man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton,\nsmiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female\nstudent asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she\nemphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if\ndemonstrating the size of a fish.\nThen a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into\ntreacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just\nexpectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. "Wealthy women\nhave rights in every country," she says. "And poor women don\'t." Her strength of feeling can\'t be hidden\nas she denounces "the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise\nsuch a fundamental personal right".\nTom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: "I understand the possible concern that we\nmight have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn\'t laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was\nsharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state." It\'s true: Clinton\ndoesn\'t quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without\nappearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight\nahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts haven\'t left her. Perhaps it is\nthe lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the\npodium at a joint appearance with Argentina\'s president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her\nsatisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the\nstage.\nYet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her "almost inhuman loyalty"\ntowards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an "information carnivore" one of her officials calls her -\ncomes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the\nforeign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself.\nIn Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive\ndiscrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro-\nBrazilians account for more than half the country\'s population but only 2 per cent of university students.\n"That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so\nthat they can have a chance to succeed," she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before\nspeaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She\nsays: "The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it\ndemonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States."\nAmong the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. It\'s hard to think of a more fulsome\nstatement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead\nand millions of dollars in the struggle against him.\nThe great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama\nadministration\nWhen I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the\nobedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne "that\'s politics". She adds: "We\'re\nworking really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to\nme." Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. "I always run\ninclusive and successful organisations," she retorts when I ask her whether she\'d applied any lessons from\nthat searing experience to her new post.\nShe admits she didn\'t want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the\nSenate -. "but at the end of the day, I\'m pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do\nsomething, you\'d better have a really good reason why you can\'t." Also, she adds: "Suppose I had won\nand I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes."\nOthers say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton\nhas moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than\nbefore. "Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised\nthat," says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. "The relationship is\nbased on her performance in the job."\nBy all accounts, it\'s a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good\nworking relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an\nalliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is\nGates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been\npopular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration -\nas was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both.\nIn truth, Clinton\'s language remains harder-edged than Obama\'s - she recently claimed that Iran\'s\nRevolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he\nis to hint at using the military. "She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time," says Kurt\nVolker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush.\nShe has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of\nIsrael and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama.\nMeanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides\nsay they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill\nClinton gives her strategic advice. "One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a\nkind of baseball saying," she says: "Don\'t major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines\nbut the trend lines."\nIt is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the\nchief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office,\nshe replies "the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying\nand solving problems." A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine.\nBut maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades,\nwhen the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable\nare the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but\nneeds instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a\nsmart decision - by all accounts she\'s overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had\ntowards her.\n"It\'s fair to say that she was not born into the administration\'s inner circle but slowly but surely, for the\nmost consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table," says one official. Praising what he\ncalls her "Terminator-quality durability and determination," he adds: "She\'s done an amazing amount of\nwork, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details."\nIndeed, Clinton\'s ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She\nhas dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her\nconfirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the\nmeeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She\nherself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her\ncampaign claims of expertise in the field. "It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around\nall of these issues," she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the\nway she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze\na few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, "you may be in a different city\nfour times a day but you have a message you\'re trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your\naudience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries\' problems, six different regional or global\nchallenges in the course of a day."\nAs the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of\ninternational issues. She is at the forefront of the US\'s efforts to consolidate relations with a number of\nimportant countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey,\nIndonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She\nsays the push is working, hailing a "change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the\nUS" - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and\nover Israel\'s raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid\nquestioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration\'s policies.\nDuring my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the\ncountry\'s increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration\'s push to\nsecure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her\ncause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil\'s foreign\nminister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces "an Iran that runs to\nBrazil" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China "telling different things to different people to\navoid international sanctions". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions\non Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. "Of course, I don\'t agree\nwith everything the Secretary said," he says.\nIt is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the\nUnited Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton\'s biographers\ndescribed his approach to government as a "permanent campaign", and it appears to be his wife\'s\npreferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton\'s life, it is that she never throws in\nher cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service.\n"Never, never!" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the\nfrustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. "I have a very realistic sense of what high-\nstakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it\'s shocking when you are in the\narena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding,\nbut you can\'t take it personally." Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She\'s been listening to\ncoverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders\' wives.\n"Whether a woman\'s running for office or she\'s supporting her husband who\'s running for office and she\ngets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there\'s just a lot of history that\nyou bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena," she says.\nAnother country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica\nInjustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many\nother incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. "I feel passionately it is in not\njust the American national security interests but the world\'s, that women be given the opportunities and\nthe tools to make the most out of their own lives," she says.\nIn the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she\nsays, "I certainly don\'t read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do\nmy job." "It\'s all baloney," says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is\nsitting to one side in her office.\n"Yeah, yeah, right, that\'s what he tells me," Clinton responds.\nI wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by\ntalking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will\nonly serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I\nask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: "I\'d love that,\nobviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens."\n"Any chance it would be you?" I ask.\n"No, no, I don\'t think that\'s in the cards," Clinton says. She\'s given more categoric denials in the past. "I\nthink that there\'s a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women\nwho are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to\nrun for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that\'s just a fact." But, says one US\nofficial, "all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with\nelectoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She\'s already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: \'What\'s the idea\nbehind raising her domestic profile still further?"\nIndeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say\nshe could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections.\nBack in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The\njourney goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard\nroad. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather\nfewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton,\nlong one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever.\nDaniel Dombey is the FT\'s US diplomatic correspondent\nDavid Miliband: "Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour"\nIt\'s too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is\nlaying the foundations for long-term change in America\'s foreign policy. The challenges are immense -\nprobably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is\nessential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and\noverlapping forums - is real and right.\nYou also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers\nmeeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have\nturned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me.\nThat said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her\nhard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great\nsense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself\nas well as at others.\nShe\'s a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks\nstrategically as well as tactically. She\'s also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in\na particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a\nnecessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it\'s\nessential to take part.\nThere\'s one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the\npeople she\'s dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It\'s real emotional intelligence in\ntrying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why\nso many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague.\nDavid Miliband is shadow foreign secretary\nGideon Rachman: "Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly\nclose"\nA school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton\'s stint as secretary of state would have to give\nher 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven.\nSecretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless\nbureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in\npromoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry\nKissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him\nall the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush\'s first secretary of state, was widely\nadmired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which\nlimited his ability to get things done in the wider world.\nHillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so\ndamaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the\ncampaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the\nWhite House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton\nappointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is\nrather detached from Obama\'s inner circle. Obama\'s penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign\ncapitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than\nanyone else to define his administration\'s approach to the world.\nThat still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have\nbeen appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy.\nAsked about Clinton\'s impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and\nsays: "She\'s done some great trips, and she\'s highly professional. But it\'s hard to see any particular area\nwhere she has really driven policy."\nGideon Rachman is the FT\'s chief foreign affairs columnist\nDavid Rothkopf: "When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly"\nHillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued\nhis agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with\nother members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department.\nThat includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise\nof new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy\nstructure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with\nprivate and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats.\nWhen the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly.\nThis has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing.\nStill, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the\nmost powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the\nsituation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely\ndifficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea\'s nuclear programmes, the rise of\nemerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises.\nWe have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to\none where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to\nwork in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of\nthose things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office.\nHillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature\nissues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.\nDavid Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace with expertise in\nnational security',)

He might\nleave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on\nwhether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.\nAnd even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in\nD.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in\nWashington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel.\nHe\'s shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White House\nstaffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he\ntraveled in Israel for his son\'s bar mitzvah.\nAnd in a broader sense, it\'s hard to imagine Emanuel\'s huge personality extracted from\nthe political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama\'s Washington.\nTake the last game of last week\'s NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander\ninto Tunnicliff\'s Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the\nnation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joined\nby a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);\nJim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of\nfavorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.\nDespite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama\'s "idealism" and is\nracing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman\nstill loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn\'t made up his mind when\nhe\'s leaving, people who know him said.\n"This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless," Emanuel said in a statement\npushing back against a story in the U.K.\'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless!\nand fed up.\nReplacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the\nsmall clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.\nFor one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political\nlandscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more\nhouse of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive\npower against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel\'s successor will\nneed some of his legislative skills.\nBarring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn\'t likely to\nreach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.\nStill, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite\nlikely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenW\nhead of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major\nliberal think tank with close ties to the administration.\nRouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama\'s Senate chief of staff, is considered the\nbest pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according\nto a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants.\nBut Rouse\'s colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead\nand his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless\nObama insisted.\n"The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very\ncomfortable with him in charge," said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.\n"But he probably won\'t take it."\nOne possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel\'s political go-to guy\n— is likely to play a major role in Obama\'s 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to\nmove to Chicago sometime next year.\nIn Messina\'s absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom\nDonilon — has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the\nsituation.\nObama has been impressed by Donilon\'s presentations at the President\'s Daily Briefing,\nand the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,\nserving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department\nspokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama\nprepare for debates against John McCain.\nOne major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,\nthe bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory\noversight.\nDavid Plouffe, Obama\'s 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation\nfor discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to\nsettle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though\nhis nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he\nfailed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.\nAnother White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama\'s for his legislative savvy\nand political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience\nthat other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill won\'t mean much if\nDemocrats surrender their majorities in either house.\nThen there\'s Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden\'s brainy and politically astute chief\nof staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower\nExecutive Office Building to the West Wing.\nKlain — who also served as Al Gore\'s chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the White\nHouse. Plus, he\'s got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie\n"Recount," about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.\nKlain\'s downside: He\'s essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport\nwith the president, according to insiders.\nC 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC',)
('http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/06/the-israeli-medias-flotilla-fail/\nThe Israeli Media\'s Flotilla Fail\nOn 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal\nMy summaty of the Israeli media\'s shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in\nHebrew at Dvorit Shargal\'s excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows:\nIf the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an\nequally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesman\'s Office churned out one misleading claim\nafter another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the public\'s mind a version of events that\nbore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israel\'s most\nrespected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDF\'s rapidly changing versions of\nevents. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers\' links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and\ntheir terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent\nreporters forced the IDF to retract or "clarify" all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or\ncovered them up without acknowledgment.\nIt so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do\nsomething which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic it\'s supposed to be applied routinely:\nAsking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging\nfrom Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their\njob for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report.\nOn June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, "Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda\nmercenaries." The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara\npassengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioth\'s Ron Ben-Yishai, who was\nembedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an "interrogation" of Marmara\npassengers — "lynchers," he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, "Some among the [flotilla passengers] are\nbelieved to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda." The article made no reference to any efforts on part of\nBen Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous\noperatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldn\'t they? •\nOn June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesman\'s Office\nto demand further evidence of the Marmara\'s Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the\nIDF\'s Israel and North America desks: "We don\'t have any evidence. The press release was based on information from\nthe National Security Council." Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, "Attackers\nof IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers." Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai\'s article remains\nuncorrected.\nOn June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval\nwarship. "Go back to Aushwitz!" a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and\nreproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded\nlike a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman\'s Office website, they\nwould have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with\nno mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the "Aushwitz" clip, yet Arraf\nwas not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public\nhysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism?\nOn my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF\'s footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the\nIDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a "clarification" and a new clip claiming to consist of the\n"full" exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify.\nDespite the IDF\'s admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least\naltered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing\ninternational attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel\'s parochial press\ncorps.\nOn June 7, Haaretz\'s Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla\npassengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that\nKen O\'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair\'s sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit\nin the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman\'s Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to\nsupport their press release. "There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case," Sgt. Chen Arad told me.\n"Obviously I\'m unable to give you more information." Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in\nthe same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact?\nJoined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime\ndeception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval\ncommandos — the flotilla passengers\' side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching\nattempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support\neither accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesman\'s Office depicting a\nbearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind\nthe man. Haaretz\'s caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken "after" the commandos had\nboarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once\nagain, the IDF\'s story was fishy.\nI called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesman\'s Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photo\'s\nquestionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the\nphoto was taken "after" the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did\nHaaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesman\'s\nOffice. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the country\'s media.\nIn the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global media\'s investigation into the\nbloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the\neyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted\ninto the IDF\'s hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who\nremembered to view claims by any nation\'s military with extreme skepticism.\nSo why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims\nare retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon\ntheir duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to\ninformation? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a\nvital source of information, need to know.',)
('The Runaway General\nStanley McChrystal, Obama\'s top commander in Afghanistan,\nhas seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the\nreal enemy: The wimps in the White House\nBy Michael Hastings\nJun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT\nThis article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.\n\'Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?" demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It\'s a Thursday night in mid-April,\nand the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in\nParis. He\'s in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually\nhave allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United\nStates. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany\'s president\nand sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to\nkeep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him.\n"The dinner comes with the position, sir," says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn.\nMcChrystal turns sharply in his chair.\n"Hey, Charlie," he asks, "does this come with the position?"\nMcChrystal gives him the middle finger.\nThe general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations\ncenter. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel\'s thick carpet,\nhooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian\ncasual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his\nadvisers says, is the "most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine." The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any\nplace with candles on the tables as too "Gucci." He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega\nNights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt\ncomfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the\nPentagon\'s most secretive black ops.\n"What\'s the update on the Kandahar bombing?" McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car\nbombs in the past day alone, calling into question the general\'s assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban.\n"We have two KIAs, but that hasn\'t been confirmed," Flynn says.\nMcChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in\nRescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If you\'ve fucked up or\ndisappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice.\n"I\'d rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner," McChrystal says.\nHe pauses a beat.\n"Unfortunately," he adds, "no one in this room could do it."\nWith that, he\'s out the door.\n"Who\'s he going to dinner with?" I ask one of his aides.\n"Some French minister," the aide tells me. "It\'s fucking gay."\nThe next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French\nmilitary academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes\nwith a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss\noff almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he\ngave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as\n"shortsighted," saying it would lead to a state of "Chaos-istan." The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president\nhimself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal\nseemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile\nNow, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get\ntoday, and how he should respond. "I never know what\'s going to pop out until I\'m up there, that\'s the problem," he says.\nThen, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one-\nliner.\n"Are you asking about Vice President Biden?" McChrystal says with a laugh. "Who\'s that?"\n"Biden?" suggests a top adviser. "Did you say: Bite Me?"\nWhen Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign\npromise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. "I want the\nAmerican people to understand," he announced in March 2009. "We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle\nand defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan." He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since\nthe war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David\nMcKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn\'t know and had\nmet only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in\nmore than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War.\nEven though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The\ngeneral first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials\nin a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama\nlooked "uncomfortable and intimidated" by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the\nOval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn\'t go much better. "It was a 10-minute\nphoto op," says an adviser to McChrystal. "Obama clearly didn\'t know anything about him, who he was. Here\'s the guy\nwho\'s going to run his fucking war, but he didn\'t seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed."\nFrom the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a\ncontroversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the\nPentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military\'s preference for high-tech violence with the demands of\nfighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the\nenemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation\'s government — a\nprocess that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially\nrebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare:\nThink the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his\n"surge" in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials.\nNicknamed "COINdinistas" for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution\nfor Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it.\nAs McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists\nin Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out.\nAfter arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary\nRobert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn\'t send another\n40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of "mission failure."\nThe White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak\non national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was\ndetermined to kick the president\'s ass.\nLast fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in\nAfghanistan. "I found that time painful," McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. "I was selling an\nunsellable position." For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against\nexperienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in\nAfghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. "The entire\nCOIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people," says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading\ncritic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. "The idea that we are going to spend a trillion\ndollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense.\nIn the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the\npresident laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: It\'s expensive; we\'re in an economic\ncrisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan.\nThen, without ever using the words "victory" or "win," Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops\nto Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly,\nbehind the counterinsurgency crowd.\nToday, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak.\nIn June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions\nof dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S.\ntroops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that\nbegan in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it\nas a "bleeding ulcer." In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and\nObama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The\npresident finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even\nthough it\'s precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he\ndidn\'t want.\nEven those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to\naccomplish in Afghanistan, it\'s going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. "It\'s not going to look like a win, smell\nlike a win or taste like a win," says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. "This is going\nto end in an argument."\nThe night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O\'Shea\'s, an Irish pub catering to tourists,\naround the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she\nhas seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie\'s 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has\ninvited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the "least Gucci" place his staff could find. His wife isn\'t surprised.\n"He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear," she says with a laugh.\nThe general\'s staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs.\nThere\'s a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two\nfighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as\nTeam America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves\non their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about\nchanging the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had\ntaken to deriding ISAF as short for "I Suck at Fighting" or "In Sandals and Flip-Flops.") McChrystal banned alcohol on\nbase, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands\nof officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub\nmodeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg\'s offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary\nfor sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend\naround the general, I witness him eating only once.) It\'s a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a\nstaple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man\nsingle-handedly winning the war.\nBy midnight at Kitty O\'Shea\'s, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps\nfrom a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal\'s top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own\ninvention."Afghanistan!" they bellow."Afghanistan!" They call it their Afghanistan song.\nMcChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. "All these men," he tells me. "I\'d die for them. And they\'d die\nfor me."\nThe assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group\nrepresents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable\ncommand of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an\nassortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special\nRepresentative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into\nthe mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal\'s team to call\nthe shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. "It jeopardizes the mission,"\nsays Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. "The military cannot\nby itself create governance reform."\nPart of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State\nDepartment receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit\nabout many of Obama\'s top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and\nveteran of the Cold War, a "clown" who remains "stuck in 1985." Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide,\n"turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk\nshows. Frankly, it\'s not very helpful." Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystal\'s inner circle. "Hillary\nhad Stan\'s back during the strategic review," says an adviser. "She said, \'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.\'"\nMcChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. "The Boss says\nhe\'s like a wounded animal," says a member of the general\'s team. "Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he\'s going to\nget fired, so that makes him dangerous. He\'s a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp\nonto. But this is COIN, and you can\'t just have someone yanking on shit."\nAt one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. "Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke," he groans. "I\ndon\'t even want to open it." He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in\nhis pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance.\n"Make sure you don\'t get any of that on your leg," an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail.\nBy far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador.\nAccording to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and\n2005 — can\'t stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He\'s also furious that McChrystal, backed by\nNATO\'s allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the\ndiplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively\nincreased McChrystal\'s influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. "In reality, that position needs to be filled\nby an American for it to have weight," says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations.\nThe relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New\nYork Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal\'s\nstrategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as "not an adequate strategic partner," and cast doubt on whether the\ncounterinsurgency plan would be "sufficient" to deal with Al Qaeda. "We will become more deeply engaged here with no\nway to extricate ourselves," Eikenberry warned, "short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and\nchaos."\nMcChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. "I like Karl, I\'ve known him for years, but they\'d never said\nanything like that to us before," says McChrystal, who adds that he felt "betrayed" by the leak. "Here\'s one that covers his\nflank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, \'I told you so.\'"\nThe most striking example of McChrystal\'s usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not\ndiplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead\nAfghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered\ncredible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied\nthe president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar.\nIn February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the president\'s palace to get\nhim to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzai\'s staff, however, insisted that the\npresident was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted\nthe aid of Afghanistan\'s defense minister, who persuaded Karzai\'s people to wake the president from his nap.\nThis is one of the central flaws with McChrystal\'s counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government\nputs us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader we\'ve backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his\ncable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. "He\'s been locked up in his\npalace the past year," laments one of the general\'s top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined\nMcChrystal\'s desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S.\nsoldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. "General," he called out to McChrystal, "I didn\'t even know we were\nfighting in Uruzgan!"\nGrowing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him\nthroughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all\njoined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he\nmade no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a\nfastball down the middle.\nMcChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the\nlast to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The "Prison on the Hudson," as it was known then, was a\npotent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights,\nand birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called "rat fucking," which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or\nmud, covered in shaving cream. "It was pretty out of control," says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to\nserve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls "huge talent" and\n"wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism," also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S.\nforces in Iraq.\nThe son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to\nthrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more\nthan 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a\n"century man." One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after\ndowning a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours\nsubjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. "I\'d come visit, and I\'d\nend up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area," recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal\nin 1973.\nMcChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as\nbrilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary\nmagazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his\ncareer. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year-\nold soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In "Brinkman\'s Note," a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator\nappears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the\nassassin, and he\'s able to infiltrate the White House: "The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the\nraincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkman\'s failure, I had succeeded."\nAfter graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. "We really\nfelt we were a peacetime generation," he recalls. "There was the Gulf War, but even that didn\'t feel like that big of a deal."\nSo McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental\ncommander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen\nRangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who\nwant to climb the ranks to general don\'t go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers\noutdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts,\nrequired every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance\nwith weekly marches involving heavy backpacks.\nIn the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvard\'s Kennedy School of\nGovernment and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks\nof humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as\na troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting\ntossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that\nfollowed September 11th. "He was very focused," says Annie. "Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he\nwanted to do. I don\'t think his personality has changed in all these years."\nBy some accounts, McChrystal\'s career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman\nduring the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander\nwith a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous "stuff happens"\nremark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president\'s Mission\nAccomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint —\noverseeing the military\'s most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part\nin a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man.\nAfter Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April\n2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He\nsigned off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire.\n(McChrystal would later claim he didn\'t read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander\nknown for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command,\nspecifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman\'s death. "If the circumstances of\nCorporal Tillman\'s death become public," he wrote, it could cause "public embarrassment" for the president.\n"The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pat\'s true actions," wrote Tillman\'s mother,\nMary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the "golden\nboy" of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping\nthe chain of command. Nine days after Tillman\'s death, McChrystal was promoted to major general.\nTwo years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in\nIraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of\nabuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even\nthough an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so\nunsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in\nAfghanistan, viewing them as a "political swamp," according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for\nhis confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the\nscandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in\nAfghanistan.\nThe media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a\ndweeb, a teacher\'s pet with a Ranger\'s tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a "Jedi" commander, as Newsweek called\nhim. He didn\'t care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor\nrare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on\nhis iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name\nand four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. ("There are no limits. There are only plateaus,\nand you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.") He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq,\nunprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. "The fucking\nlads love Stan McChrystal," says a British officer who serves in Kabul. "You\'d be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone\nwould take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like \'Who the fuck is that?\' And it\'s fucking Stan McChrystal."\nIt doesn\'t hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite\nforces that carry out the government\'s darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of\ninsurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. "JSOC was a killing machine," says Maj. Gen.\nMayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist\nnetworks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned\nby the military. "The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT,\nsitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming," says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal\nin Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. "He\'d say, \'Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldn\'t find lunch without help.\nYou got to work together with these guys.\'"\nEven in his new role as America\'s leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts\nof a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from\nfour to 19. "You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight," McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the\nhallway at headquarters. Then he\'ll add, "I\'m going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though." In fact, the general\nfrequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this\nyear, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created\ntremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special\nForces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests\nerupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. "We\'ve shot an amazing number of\npeople," McChrystal recently conceded.\nDespite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that\nthe U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It\'s "insurgent math," as he calls it — for every innocent person you\nkill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air\npower and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates\ncommanders responsible for civilian deaths. "For a while," says one U.S. official, "the most dangerous place to be in\nAfghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a \'civ cas\' incident." The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make\nnot killing into something you can win an award for: There\'s talk of creating a new medal for "courageous restraint," a\nbuzzword that\'s unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military.\nBut however strategic they may be, McChrystal\'s new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own\ntroops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. "Bottom line?" says a former Special\nForces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of\nengagement put soldiers\' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing."\nIn March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront\nsuch accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had\nreceived an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit.\n"I am writing because it was said you don\'t care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves," Arroyo\nwrote.\nWithin hours, McChrystal responded personally: "I\'m saddened by the accusation that I don\'t care about soldiers, as it is\nsomething I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend\nupon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldier\'s view is his own." Then he showed up at Arroyo\'s\noutpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live\noperation in a dangerous war zone.\nSix weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year-\nold corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED\na day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general\nwould attend Ingram\'s memorial service. "He started to look up to you," Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to\nmake it down to pay his respects as soon as possible.\nThe night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyo\'s platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM\nto speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard\ntowers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen\nsome of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingram\'s death. His commanders had\nrepeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a\ncombat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystal\'s new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been\ndenied. "These were abandoned houses," fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. "Nobody was coming back to live in them."\nOne soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. "Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably\ncertain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force," the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has\ntraveled halfway around the world to fight, that\'s like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he won\'t\nhave to make arrests. "Does that make any fucking sense?" asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. "We should just drop a fucking\nbomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?"\nThe rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — they\'ve been distorted as they passed through the chain of\ncommand — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. "Fuck, when I came over here and\nheard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on," says Hicks, who has served three tours\nof combat. "I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his\nbird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, they\'re all fucked up — either because\nsomebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just don\'t understand it themselves. But we\'re fucking losing this\nthing."\nMcChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two\ndozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. "I ask you what\'s going on in your world, and I think it\'s important for you all to\nunderstand the big picture as well," McChrystal begins. "How\'s the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for\nyourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like you\'re losing?" McChrystal says.\n"Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think we\'re losing, sir," says Hicks.\nMcChrystal nods. "Strength is leading when you just don\'t want to lead," he tells the men. "You\'re leading by example.\nThat\'s what we do. Particularly when it\'s really, really hard, and it hurts inside." Then he spends 20 minutes talking about\ncounterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense,\nbut he\'s careful not to bullshit the men. "We are knee-deep in the decisive year," he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no\nlonger has the initiative — "but I don\'t think we do, either." It\'s similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but it\'s not winning any\nhearts and minds among the soldiers. "This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks," McChrystal tries to joke.\n"But it doesn\'t get the same reception from infantry companies."\nDuring the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use\nlethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they\ndid in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. \'We aren\'t putting fear into the Taliban," one soldier says.\n"Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing," McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can\'t\nkill your way out of Afghanistan. "The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didn\'t work."\n"I\'m not saying go out and kill everybody, sir," the soldier persists. "You say we\'ve stopped the momentum of the\ninsurgency. I don\'t believe that\'s true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger it\'s\ngetting."\n"I agree with you," McChrystal says. "In this area, we\'ve not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here,\nyou have to use fire. What I\'m telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out\nhere and resettle it?"\nA soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn\'t have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a\ncivilian. "That\'s the way this game is," McChrystal says. "It\'s complex. I can\'t just decide: It\'s shirts and skins, and we\'ll kill\nall the shirts."\nAs the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasn\'t succeeded at easing the men\'s anger. He makes one\nlast-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. "There\'s no way I can make that easier," he tells\nthem. "No way I can pretend it won\'t hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, you\'re doing a great job.\nDon\'t let the frustration get to you." The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold\nPresident Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men aren\'t buying it.\nWhen it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystal\'s side. The only foreign invader to have any success here\nwas Genghis Khan — and he wasn\'t hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny.\nThe COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent\nmemory: France\'s nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975).\nMcChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy,\nexpensive and easy to lose. "Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan," he says. But even if he somehow manages to\nsucceed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to\nshut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools,\nroads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying\nArkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. "It\'s all very cynical, politically," says Marc Sageman, a former CIA\ncase officer who has extensive experience in the region. "Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — there\'s nothing for us\nthere."\nIn mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by\nHamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in\nKabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the\npraises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian\ncasualties. They mention the word "progress" 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the •\nsession represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystal\'s strategy in months. "There is no\ndenying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic\ndevelopment," the president says. "As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been\nvisible just a few years earlier."\nIt is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no\nreal progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. "It was one of our first\nimpressions," one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. "So many\nlights shining brightly." So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of\nprogress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have\nmocked. "They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even\ndefined or recognizable," says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political\nadviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. "That\'s the game we\'re in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is\nto create the perception that we didn\'t get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become\ngreat in the near future."\nBut facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those\nclosest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesn\'t begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things\nare in Afghanistan. "If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,"\na senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesn\'t prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from\ndreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its\ncounterinsurgency campaign even further. "There\'s a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next\nsummer if we see success here," a senior military official in Kabul tells me.\nBack in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of "progress,"\nMcChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning\nto launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the country\'s second-largest city and the Taliban\'s original\nhome base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that\nMcChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more\ngroundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like\nFallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a "rising tide of security." The Afghan police and\narmy will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city\nto win over the civilian population.\nEven proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. "This isn\'t a classic operation," says a\nU.S. military official. "It\'s not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren\'t going to be doors kicked in." Other U.S. officials\ninsist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that it\'s going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja.\n"The Taliban have a jackboot on the city," says a military official. "We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way\nthat doesn\'t alienate the population." When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders\nsay he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall.\n"This looks like CT-plus!" he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.\nWhatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years\nof war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that\nCOIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his\ninfluence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things\nworse. "Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem," says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who\nhas studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. "A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government\nand creates an environment where we\'re picking winners and losers" — a process that fuels resentment and hostility\namong the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the\nprimary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using\nthe word "victory" when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with\nStanley McChrystal in charge.\nThis article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.',)

The destruction was part of\na larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indian\nreservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewish\nsettlers, including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after a\npeace treaty is signed. For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them\nfrom the map by establishing "facts on the ground" in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib\'s\ndemolition here).\nMoments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on\nfurniture taken from a family\'s home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News.\nOne of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot\npolice who stormed the village were accompanied by "busloads of cheering civilians." Who were these civilians and why\ndidn\'t CNN or any outlet investigate further?\nI traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta\'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewish\nstruggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village\'s traumatized\nchildren, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished\nhomes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib\'s residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about the\nidentity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated the\ndemolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen \'elders of\nthe village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I had\nima. med.\nIsraeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib family\nArab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. They\ndepicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I\n\'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into the\nvillagers\' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers\nsmashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they lounged\naround on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, according to Matyam, the volunteers\ncelebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes.\n"What we learned from the summer camp of destruction," Madyam remarked, "is that Israeli youth are not being educated\non democracy, they are being raised on racism." (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam\'s Arab Negev News features a\nphoto of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. The\nheadline reads, "Nakba 2010.")\n0\nAccording to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village\nThe Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli police\nvolunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state\'s military\napparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib took\nfrom their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach\'\nadulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat the\nArab outclass as less than human. The volunteers\' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally\nin Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in\nHebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinction\nbetween the two cases, it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize\nArab property as agents of the state.\nThe spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students do\nnot believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, the\nwidespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel\'s authoritarian trend. It\nwould be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garb\nencoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values.\nYouth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in\nAs for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens\nagainst one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionist\nfounding father Chaim Weizmann, "obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path." Historically, only failing states\nhave encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolished\nhomes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than the\ndestruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste\n0\n...and the destruction begins',)

('August 8, 2010\nGary Sick\nAmerica and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats\nFor the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel\nand/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change\nits nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no.\nNeither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the\ncrowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages,\nwhere it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it\nis either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment.\nUber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush\nadministration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it\nunequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his\nsubsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential\nconsequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the\nreported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack\nObama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it.\nSanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security\nand survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq\nin the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of\nIraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had\nabandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and\nhis enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him.\nOne of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there\nwas no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen\nmanaged the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund\nTariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be\ngood for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had\nmade criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The\nbiggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam\nHussein.\nWhich brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of\nfinancial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant\nproblems for the leadership. Iran\'s critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of\ncheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring.\nThis siphons off a lot of Iran\'s oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard\ncurrency.\nAt the same time, because Iran\'s oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain\nproduction. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil\ncompanies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by\nIran\'s own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside\ninvestors. As a result, Iran\'s oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked\nup by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Iran\'s hard currency\nearnings are drying up at an alarming rate.\nThis unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent\neconomic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamene\'i, the Supreme Leader,\nseems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary\nGuards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shah\'s regime\ncould have imagined.\nPresident Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish\nand irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect\ndrives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions\nagainst Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad\nagent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the\nsame time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits.\nBut to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the "third rail" of\nIranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of\nsubsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations.\nBut these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Iran\'s energy dilemma. He is now\naddressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing\nthe bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress.\nThese are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the\nInternational Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic\ninterests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles\nhis populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and\nIsrael the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his\nown eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them.\nThe key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran\nis capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The\nRevolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Iran\'s military, its economy, and its politics. Iran\nincreasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and \'30s that\nwe call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right\nwho choose to believe that Khamene\'i is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic\nconservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose\nobjective is to put the "republic" back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice.\nThis is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next.\nAnd this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will\nback the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with\ndomestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will\ninadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat\nfor everything that goes wrong in Iran.',)

The city\'s big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin\'s\nmarriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away.\nWell, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, "I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win" —\nold wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old\ngrievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this:\nNo, they don\'t and they never will. But, we\'re public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on.\nSpeaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in\nArmenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia and\nTurkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915.\nYou\'ve got to salute Hillary. She\'s got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It\'s a heck of a job being secretary of state\nwhen the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — and\nyou\'re left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you\'re lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa.\nThe situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House — and they are overwhelmingly boys — were\nforeign-policy heavyweights. They\'re not. Indeed, I\'m told Henry Kissinger refers to them as "the kids."\nChief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council\'s chief\nof staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: "Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert\nM. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obama\'s inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a\n40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans."\nI do know McDonough and I\'ve spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the state\'s qualities: positive,\nbrisk, can-do, affable and efficient.\nBut am I reassured when! read that Obama\'s national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great\nguy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but he\'s not a great guy to\nthink big about the world.\nThinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an\nAfghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiation\nwith the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions\nhave changed nothing. Obama\'s apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing.\nThen there\'s Israel-Palestine, where Obama can\'t decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both\nsides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that he\'s zigzagging to little effect.\nAfter firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign-\npolicy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French —\nthe French love that — but he\'s left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones\' deputy, dances around the vacuum\nas best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they\nbe foreign-policy strategists?\nIn Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno-\nKarabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non-\ncritical affairs.\nBack in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald\nTribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley:\n"Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent,\ndraw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE."\nHe was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake\nTanganyika, uttering the immortal words: "Doctor Livingstone, I presume?"\nThat sort of journalism\'s gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling\nMichael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that. He also found\nsomething else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it.\nMcChrystal\'s gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch this space.',)

"I believe he is ready to take risks for peace."\nA newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a\nradically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed\nthe Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to "beat them up,\nnot once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it\'s unbearable" (all translations are mine).\nPI to Haaretz\'s Gideon Levy, the video should be "Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and\ndistributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel."\nNetanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping\ndown as prime minister in 1999.

"America is\'a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction.\nThey won\'t get in their way." He then called former president Bill Clinton "radically pro-Palestinian," and went on to belittle\nthe Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to\npre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast\nswaths of land as just that.\n"They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords]," Netanyahu said.

('\'Inept\' US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010\nRIYADH (AFP)— An "inept" United States cannot fix Afghanistan\'s problems and should simply focus on "chasing the\nterrorists" there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday.\nThe ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East\npeace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free.\nAFP — Saudi Arabia\'s former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ...\nIn a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and\nhad no hope of rebuilding the country.\n"What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists," Turki told the Arab\nNews conference.\nUS President Barack Obama "should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan\'s ills by military\nmeans."\n"Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the\nAfghan people deal with their problems.\n"As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological\nmercenaries."\nTurki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington\'s handling of relations with\nKabul.\n"The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement.\n"Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths," he said. "How can they both get out of that\nsituation? I don\'t know."\nThe chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to\noften reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government.\nHe is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister\nwhen Saud retires.\nTurki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.\n"The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done," said Turki.\n"It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk.\n"If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the\nPalestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist.\n"He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the\nIsraelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please."\nTurki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Iran\'s alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon.\n"The discussions on Iran\'s nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not\nwork," he said.\nFor one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear\ncountries on the other.\n"You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels."\nTurki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a "universal nuclear security umbrella" for the\ncountries in the area, and "a good military option" against any regional country which does not cooperate.\nHe said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council\'s five\npermanent members recently expressed support for the idea.\n"Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,"\nhe said.\n"Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?"\nTurki said he hoped Obama "will find the way to correct his secretary of state\'s nullification of making our area free of\nweapons of mass destruction."\nTurki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external\ngroups seek to carve up the country.\n"Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates" following the US pullout, he said.\nWithout a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraq\'s current borders, the consequence could be "regional conflict on a\nscale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries," he warned.',)
('H: I\'m sure you are preoccupied with the adventures of Lula, et al. Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY\nReview, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It\'s worth reading, not least for Frank\nLuntz\'s poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted in\nthis long-term and profound development. Sid\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/\nThe Failure of the American Jewish Establishment\nJune 10, 2010\nby Peter Beinart\nE-mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinart\nanjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs\nIn 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish\ncollege students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the\nmost damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.\nThe philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn\'t. "Six\ntimes we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel," he\nreported. "Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word\n\'they\' rather than\'us` to describe the situation."\nThat Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of\nSteven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that "non-Orthodox\nyounger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders," with many professing "a near-total\nabsence of positive feelings." In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university\nin America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\nLuntz\'s task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students\' views of Israel, he hit up against some\nfirm beliefs. First, "they reserve the right to question the Israeli position." These young Jews, Luntz explained, "resist\nanything they see as \'group think." They want an "open and frank" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, "young\nJews desperately want peace." When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled "Proof that\nIsrael Wants Peace," and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, "some\nempathize with the plight of the Palestinians." When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful,\nseveral focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends.\nMost of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of\nAmerican Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human\nrights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and\ncapable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did\nnot grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment\nhas been working against for most of their lives.\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to\nthe State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to\nhuman rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger\ngenerations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal.\nOne reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a\nZionism that challenges Israel\'s behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several\ndecades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism\'s door, and now, to their\nhorror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents\nof Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-\ndominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular\nAmerican Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews\ncan help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz\'s\nstudents wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel\'s current government, by no longer averting our eyes.\nSince the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew\nUniversity political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, "After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist\nnarrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions." One version, "founded on a long memory of\npersecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in\nJewish power and solidarity." Another, "nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment\nidea of progress," articulates "a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values."\nEvery country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.\nAs Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism,\nparticularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority.\nYou can see this spirit in "new historians" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist\npast and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the\nhuman rights guarantees in Israel\'s "Basic Laws." You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak\'s apparent\nwillingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\nBut in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To\nunderstand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s government, it\'s worth\nconsidering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically\ncleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. "We\'ll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here\nand remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system," he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into\nNetanyahu\'s Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu\'s special emissary for overseas "campus\nengagement." In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government\'s\nbehalf. The group that organized his tour was called "Caravan for Democracy."\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam\'s views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane\'s now\nbanned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman\'s position might be\ncalled "pre-expulsion." He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won\'t swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish\nstate. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel\'s 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the\nKnesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail\nArabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from\nother countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\nYou don\'t have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman\'s current views and his former ones. The more\nyou strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of\nexpulsion becomes. Lieberman\'s American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they\nusually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel\'s border so that a large chunk of Israeli\nArabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu\'s first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank,\nNetanyahu\'s own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé\'s. In his 1993 book, A Place among the\nNations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In\nfact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank,\nhe has declared, would be a "ghetto-state" with "Auschwitz borders." And the effort "to gouge Judea and Samaria [the\nWest Bank] out of Israel" resembles Hitler\'s bid to wrench the German-speaking "Sudeten district" from Czechoslovakia in\n1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching\nconcessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the\nJewish state.\nOn the left of Netanyahu\'s coalition sits Ehud Barak\'s emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may\nhave is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party\nrepresenting Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-\nOrthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious\nto find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies\nit is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they\nhave done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism\'s profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia\nYosef, Shas\'s immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs "vipers," "snakes," and "ants." In 2005, after Prime\nMinister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that "God strike him down." The\nofficial Shas newspaper recently called President Obama "an Islamic extremist."\nHebrew University Professor Ze\'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize.\nCommenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, "The last time politicians\nholding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Franco\'s Spain." With their\nblessing, "a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order."\nSternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\nIsraeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli\nsociety: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and\nmore entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to\nanti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent\nof recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among\nIsrael\'s young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56\npercent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students—\nwould deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey "a huge\nwarning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth."\nYou might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel\'s government, would occasion\nsubstantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In\nIsrael itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy.\n(Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an "apartheid state" if it\ncontinues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of\nthe occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that "Israel has not been democratic for\nsome time now.") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents\' Conference patrol public discourse,\nscolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn\nfor peace.\nThe result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism.\nOn its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel\'s commitment to "free speech and minority rights." The Conference of Presidents\ndeclares that "Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom,\nsecurity and peace." These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu\'s coalition, that Israeli Arabs don\'t deserve\nfull citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don\'t deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything\nany Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very\nliberal values they profess to admire.\nAfter Israel\'s elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents\'\nConference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman\'s agenda was "far more moderate than the media has presented it."\nInsisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-\nDefamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that "He\'s not saying expel them. He\'s not saying punish them."\n(Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day\nevidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish\nCommittee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman\'s proposed loyalty oath would "chill Israel\'s democratic political debate."\nBut the Forward summed up the overall response of America\'s communal Jewish leadership in its headline "Jewish\nLeaders Largely Silent on Lieberman\'s Role in Government."\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to\nprevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a\ncampaign to discredit the world\'s most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty\nInternational report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians "bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic." The Conference\nof Presidents has announced that "biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and]\nSave the Children." Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch "has repeatedly\ndemonstrated its anti-Israel bias." When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary\nRobinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had\npresided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report\nimplicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.)\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents\'\nConference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israel\'s neighbors—they\nleave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply\ndefending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist\nvisions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an "animus toward Israel," an\nalliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like\nB\'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human\nRights, have been at least as critical of Israel\'s actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty\nInternational and Human Rights Watch.\nAll of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel\'s overseas human rights critics\nare motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel\'s domestic human rights critics?\nThe implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don\'t generally say\nthat, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel\'s vice prime minister, Moshe Ya\'alon,\ncalled the anti-occupation group Peace Now a "virus." This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli\nhuman rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel\'s Gaza war. A\nKnesset member from Netanyahu\'s Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports\nsome of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman\'s party launched an investigation aimed at\ncurbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s.\nTo their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own\nwork. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel\'s government\nis motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make\nthe same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\nIn the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal\ncitizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational\nreasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are\nunmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders;\nand they are secular. They don\'t want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them\nto be agents of the Israeli right.\nThese American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to\nthe Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when\nmuch of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in\nconjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews\nembraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war,\nbefore the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture,\npolitics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas,\nAmerican Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more\ninnocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories.\nBut these secular Zionists aren\'t reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on\nIsrael\'s border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they\nhave grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than\ntheir parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption\nbecause its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents\' liberalism, they cannot embrace their\nuncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment\nis fake.\nTo sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, America\'s Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to\nreplenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank\noccupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the\nOrthodox world.\nBecause they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the\nAmerican Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make\nup only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and\ntwenty-four. For America\'s Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas\nthey learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and\noften know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of\nnon-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel "very close to Israel," among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As\nsecular Jews drift away from America\'s Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The\nOrthodox "are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns," explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University\nof New York. "They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights."\nBut it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones—\nthat gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non-\nOrthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the\nOrthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis University\'s Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he\nfound Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly,\nReform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill-\nserved by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to\ndeny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews.\nOrthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in\nthe American Jewish world. (I\'m biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue,\nthe growing influence of Orthodox Jews in America\'s Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic\nveneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, America\'s major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel\nsolidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the\nestimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul\nWolfowitz told the rally that "innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well," he was booed.\nAmerica\'s Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an\nAmerican Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish\npopulation that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up\namong the booers as among Luntz\'s focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread.\nIn 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of\nhouses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and\npolitician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the\nruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.\nIn that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he\nwatched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on\nmalnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli\nhuman rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—it\'s unpleasant.\nRationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster\nZionism among America\'s young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word "Arabs, not Palestinians," since\n"the term `Palestinians\' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression," while "Arab\' says wealth, oil\nand Islam."\nOf course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are\nmorally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies\neverything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents\' Conference should ask themselves what Israel\'s leaders would have\nto do or say to make them scream "no." After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities;\nsettlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs\nbarred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?\nWhat infuriated critics about Lapid\'s comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the\nmemory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do.\n•\nBut at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust\nanalogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about\nthemselves. Many of Israel\'s founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated\nthe non-Jews living under their dominion. "For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority," Knesset\nmember Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, "and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live\nwith a minority."\nBut the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the\nopposite: since Jews are history\'s permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a\nluxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his\nremarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, "Victimhood sets you free."\nThis obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America\'s secular Jewish young. It simply\nbears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel\'s. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah\nand Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess\ndozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the\ndilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish\nvictimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of\ntoday\'s young American Jews as farce.\nBut there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel\'s\nIndependence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state "will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and\npeace taught by the Hebrew prophets," and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others\nto The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin\'s visit to the United States after his party\'s\nmilitias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish\nfortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of\nJewish power.\nFor several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood\nof Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years,\nfrom which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a\npermit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into\nthe thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the\nface of Zionism shown to America\'s Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz\'s focus group had been told that their\ngeneration faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state\non earth?\n"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it," writes Avraham Burg. "I\nwas very comfortable there." I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral\nabdication. Let\'s hope that Luntz\'s students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an\nuncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Let\'s hope\nthey care enough to try.\n—May 12, 2010 .\nPeter Beinart is Associate Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of New York, a Senior\nFellow at the New America Foundation, and Senior Political Writer for The Daily Beast.

He explained that he was interrogated for\nseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-\nold scholar added:\nI can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he\nwas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was\nthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose\nevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an\ninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past\nbut not this time.\nMr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the\nPalestinian university in Ramallah.\nThe renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and\nhas criticized Israel\'s occupation of Palestinian territory many times.\nIn an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, "I objected to the\nfounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don\'t think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object\nto the United States as a Christian state." When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,\n"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew," he replied:\nIt is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews.

('Netanyahu pleased: I didn\'t capitulate\nBen Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post]\nIn the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister\nBinyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration.\nNetanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between\nhim and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red\nlines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn\'t want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who\nheard him speak.\nNetanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in\nSeptember. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the\nIsraeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will "make\nsure" that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take "aggressive" action and construction\nwill be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs.\nThe Prime Minister \'s Bureau vigorously denied the above report. "The statements attributed to the prime minister are\nincorrect," said a spokesman in the Prime Minister\'s Bureau. "They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is\nsimple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President\nObama and the administration to Israel\'s security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region."\nEli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might\nattest to a radical change in the White House\'s attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting\nas "the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of\nweeks." The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago\nbetween the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued\nconstruction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was "no longer an absolute\nally of the United States."\nThat crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among\nmembers of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administration\'s desire to end the crisis\nis the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. "The Democratic Party\'s coffers are empty.\nMany Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they\nwould be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections," said one source in Washington.\nThe prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months\nago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together\nand to give statements to the media.\nThat said, sources in Washington noted that "Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once\nagain. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult\nquestions, like \'how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.\'"\nNetanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel\'s acceptance\ninto the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through\nthe city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.',)

I\'ll skip the torrent of\nObama pieces (see Politico lead piece today, if you want to catch the full updraft of new conventional wisdom), but include\nHaaretz below from its editorial editor and Teddy Kollek\'s former spokesman:\n• Home\n• Print Edition\n• News\n• Published 01:58 23.08.10\n• Latest update 01:58 23.08.10\nith a victory like this..\nThe direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians\nhave preconditions - dictated by Israel.\nBy At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace\nTwo years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14\ncOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held "without\npreconditions," and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win.\nBut unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to\nenter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40\npoints), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he\nhad decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled.\nThe illuminating movie "Friendship Games," to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along\nwith Ibtisam IVIara\'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz,\nan American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to\nthe Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join\nthe other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian\nteam. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity..\nThe direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the\nconditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East\nJerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where\ntalks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the\nAnnapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one.\nThe head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging\nAbbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding\nbuilding in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on\nthe basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians.\nIt\'s time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted!\nIf Benjamin Netanyahu\'s aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then\nhe can really chalk up another victory. But Israel\'s success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the\ntournament, is not measured by the terms "victory" or "defeat." What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it\nwas won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process\nwith the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas\' standing and leads nowhere?\nWhat have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel\'s\napproach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there\'s no point in bothering so many VIPs with\nanother unnecessary summit. Let\'s assume that we\'ll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist\nAbbas\' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple\nMount. How many hours would such an agreement last?\nAll we need is a few more "victories" like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, "without preconditions," and\nwe\'ll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state\n(the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I\'m concerned).\nWhat will we do if Abbas announces that he\'s had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he\'s decided\nthe time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian\npresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?\nThis story is lojr:\n• kiva Eldar\nAkiva Eldar is the chief political columnist and an editorial writer for Haaretz.

('H: This may be worthless meandering on my part, but if the US unveils its own position in the new negotiations, inevitable\nif they are not to collapse, perhaps that position should incorporate at its heart what the Israeli government has already\nagreed to in the final status negotiations at Camp David, along, of course, with certain adjustments and amendments to\naccount for the past ten years in terms of boundaries, etc. This puts the burden on Bibi to repudiate Barak in principles\nand details if he pushes back, splitting his coalition, and appearing to be the rejectionist.

('of Rage\n1:1\nDays of Rage -- The\nNoxious\nTransformation of\nthe Conservative\nMovement into a\nRabid Fringe\nBy Max Blumenthal, Nation Books\nPosted on August 10, 2010, Printed on\nAugust 17, 2010\nhttp://www.alternet.orgistory/147784/\nEditor\'s Note: The following is\nthe new epilogue from Max\nBlumenthal\'s book, Republic\nGomorrah, now out in paperback\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009).\n"He will tell you\nthat he wants a\nstrong authority to\ntake from him the\ncrushing\nresponsibility of\nthinking for\nhimself Since the\nRepublic is weak,\nhe is led to break\nthe law out of love\nfor obedience. But\nis it really strong\nauthority that he\nwishes? In reality\nhe demands\nrigorous order for\nothers, and for\nhimself disorder\nwithout\nresponsibility." --\nJean-Paul Sartre,\n"Anti-Semite and\nJew"\nI am not sure when I first detected\nthe noxious fumes that would\nenvelop the conservative\nmovement in the Obama era. It\nmight have been early on, in\nApril 2009, when I visited a\nseries of gun shows in rural\nCalifornia and Nevada. Perusing\ntables piled high with high-\ncaliber semi-automatic weapons\nand chatting with anyone in my\nvicinity, I heard urgent warnings\nof mass roundups, concentration\ncamps, and a socialist\ngovernment in Washington.\n"These people that are purchasing\nthese guns are people that are\nworried about what\'s going on in\nthis country," a gun dealer told\nme outside a show in Reno.\n"Good luck Obama," a young gun\nenthusiast remarked to me. "We\noutnumber him 100 to 1." At this\ntime, the Tea Party movement\nhad not even registered on the\nnational media\'s radar.\nIn September 2009, I led a panel\ndiscussion about this book inside\nan auditorium filled with nearly\n100 students and faculty at the\nUniversity of California-\nRiverside. Beside me sat Jonathan\nWalton, an African-American\nprofessor of religious studies and\nprolific writer, and Mark Takano,\nan erudite, openly gay former\nDemocratic congressional\ncandidate and local community\ncollege trustee. In the middle of\nour discussion, a dozen College\nRepublicans stormed the front of\nthe stage with signs denouncing\nme as a "left-wing hack" while a\nhysterical young man leaped from\nthe crowd, blowing kisses\nmockingly at Takano while\nheckling Walton as a "racist."\nAfterward, university police\nofficers insisted on escorting me\nto my ride after the right-wing\nheckler attempted to follow me as\nhe shouted threats.\nWho was this stalker? Just a\nconcerned citizen worried about\ntaxes? His name was Ryan Sorba\nand he was an operative of a\nheavily funded national\nconservative youth outfit, the\nIntercollegiate Studies Institute.\nBesides founding dozens of\nRepublican youth groups across\nthe country, Sorba has devoted an\nexceptional amount of energy to\nhis interest in homosexuals. His\nintellectual output consists of a\ntract titled The Born Gay Hoax,\narguing that homosexuality is at\nonce a curable disease and a\nbogus trend manufactured by\nacademic leftists. Adding to his\ncredentials, Sorba has a history of\nrun-ins with the law, he explained\nwhen I called him about the\norder.\nMy encounter with this\naggressive right-wing cadre\nseemed a strange, isolated event.\nBut the hostility turned out to be\nsymptomatic of the intensifying\ncampaign to delegitimize\nPresident Obama and his allies in\nCongress. The Right\'s days of\nrage were only beginning.\nThrough his first year in office,\nObama seemed oblivious to the\nthreat of the far right. He\ncampaigned against partisanship,\ndeclaring that there were "no red\nstates" and no "conservative\nAmerica." Apparently, he thought\nit was merely a contrivance or\nmyth that there were people who\nrejected science, demonized gays,\nassailed minority and women\'s\nrights -- or that they genuinely\nbelieved in what they said.\nSpeaking of changing\nWashington, Obama seemed to\nthink that the entire history of\npolitics since the rise of Reagan\nand the Right and their strategies\nof polarization was not deeply\nrooted but a superficial problem\nattributable to certain "divisive"\npersonalities, easily wiped away\nwith gestures toward\nbipartisanship. His view of the\nparties was that they were simply\nmirror images sharing\nfundamental beliefs but separated\nby "partisans." The skilled and\ndevoted community organizer\ncould bring them together.\nMany of his supporters in the\nmedia, often part and parcel of\npolitical wars over the years,\nreinforced and amplified his\ninnocence, proclaiming he was\nthe one at last who could "bridge•\nthe partisan divide." Andrew\nSullivan, a disaffected\nconservative who once called\ncritics of George W. Bush\npolicies "fifth columnists" but\nnow fervently supporting Obama,\nwrote that the new president was\ndestined to become "a liberal\nReagan who can reunite\nAmerica." This optimism\npervaded the Obama White\nHouse as the president and his\naides sought out Republicans\nwilling to vote for his programs.\nAfter all, why couldn\'t we all just\nget along?\nIn his autobiographical book The\nAudacity of Hope, Obama\nhighlighted a key component of\nhis political strategy: "I serve as a\nblank screen on which people of\nvastly different political stripes\nproject their own views." Once he\nwas elected, conservatives\nconcluded that they could reverse\nObama\'s strength by transforming\nhim into a human tableau for the\nmost fearsome images they could\nconjure.\nObama\'s multiracial background\nwas crucial in cultivating\nresentment among the shock\ntroops. Those who rejected\nObama\'s legitimacy to serve as\npresident on the basis of his\nbackground gave birth to the\n"Birther" movement that sought\nto challenge his citizenship. The\nmovement\'s most visible figure,\nand therefore the most eccentric,\nwas Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-\ntrained lawyer who had\nimmigrated from the former\nSoviet republican of Moldova to\nIsrael before settling in the\nconservative bastion of Orange\nCounty, California. Convinced by\nclaims on the far-right Web site\nWorldNetDaily that Obama\nplanned to create a "civilian\nnational security force," Taitz\ntold me she "realized that Obama\nwas another Stalin--it\'s a cross\nbetween Stalinist USSR and\nHitler\'s Germany."\nAfter becoming transfixed by\nonline conspiracy theories\nclaiming Obama\'s family had\nforged his birth certificate in\nHawaii, Taitz snapped into\naction. She filed a lawsuit in\nNovember 2008 with California\nSecretary of State Debra Bowen\ndemanding an investigation into\nObama\'s eligibility to serve as\npresident. Taitz\'s plaintiff in the\ncase was Wiley Drake, an Orange\nCounty radio preacher and former\nsecond vice president of the\nSouthern Baptist Convention who\nonce publicly prayed for Obama\'s\ndeath. While her lawsuit went\nnowhere, and subsequent suits\nearned her angry rebukes from\njudges, Taitz became an instant\nmedia sensation, delivering\nheavily accented screeds against\nObama before friendly\ninterviewers from Sean Haimity\nto CNN\'s Lou Dobbs, who Taitz\ncalled her "greatest supporter"\nand who was eventually fired as\nan indirect result of his hosting of\nher.\nIn March 2009, Texas Rep.\nRandy Neugebauer signed on to a\nBirther bill proposing that future\npresidential candidates must\nprove their citizenship before\nbecoming eligible to campaign.\nThe Birther movement had found\nits voice in goverment and made\nan indelible impact on the\nRepublican grassroots. By June\n2009, 28 percent of Republican\nrespondents to a Kos/Research\n2000 poll said they thought\nObama wasn\'t born in the United\nStates, while 30 percent "weren\'t\nsure." "Obama should be in the\nBig House," Taitz shrieked to me,\n"not the White House!"\nWhen Obama announced health\ncare reform as the first major\ninitiative of his administration,\nthe conservative movement\nactivated a campaign of\ndemonization -- transformational\npolitics -- designed to turn Obama\ninto the "Other," making him\nseem as unfamiliar, and therefore\nas threatening, as possible. When\nthe president urged the Congress\nto deliver a health care reform bill\nin 2009, the Right staged a living\ntheater of political hatred,\nObama\'s dream of bipartisanship\ntransformed into a nightmarish\nversion of "Marat/Sade." On\nSeptember 12, 2009, tens of\nthousands of far-right activists\nbelonging to a loose\nconfederation of anti-government\ngroups called the Tea Party\nPatriots converged on\nWashington\'s National Mall for a\ngiant protest against the Obama\nhealth care plan. The date was\nsignificant: Fox News\'s top-\nranked talk show host Glenn\nBeck had declared the birth of the\n"9-12 Project" to restore the sense\nof unity -- and siege mentality --\nthat Americans experienced on\nSeptember 11, 2001. But this\ntime, Obama -- not Osama -- was\nthe enemy.\nWhile covering the rally, I\nwitnessed sign after sign\ndeclaring Obama a greater danger\nto America\'s security than al-\nQaida; demonstrators held images\nthat juxtaposed Obama\'s face\nwith images of evildoers from\nHitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;\nothers carried signs questioning\nObama\'s status as a U.S. citizen.\n"We can fight al-Qaida, we can\'t\nkill Obama," said an aging\ndemonstrator. Another told me,\n"Obama is the biggest Nazi in the\nworld," pointing to placards he\nhad fashioned depicting Obama\nand House Majority Leader\nNancy Pelosi in SS outfits.\nAccording to another activist,\nObama\'s agenda was similar to\nHitler\'s: "Hitler took over the\nbanking industry, did he not? And\nHitler had his own personal secret\nservice police. [The community-\norganizing group] ACORN is an\nextension of that."\nThe seemingly incongruous Tea\nParty propaganda recalled signs\nwaved by right-wing Jewish\nsettlers during rallies against\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak\nRabin and his support of the\npeace process, portraying him as\nan SS officer and as the French\ncollaborator Marshall Petain. In\n1995, amid the provocative\natmosphere, a young right-wing\nJewish zealot assassinated Rabin.\nThe Israeli tragedy was a\ncautionary example of targeted\nhatred leading to violence.\nMembers of the Tea Party\n"Patriots" did not seem to care\nthat their rhetoric was irrational,\nor that comparing Obama to\nHitler and Stalin was\ncontradictory and obviously\nhyperbolic. Their motives were\nentirely negative. By purging\ngovernment of the multicultural\nevil that had seized power\nthrough illicit means (several\nactivists told me they believed\nACORN helped Obama steal the\nelection), they were convinced\nthat a mythical golden American\nyesteryear would return. They\nhad no interest in building\nanything new or even articulating\nan agenda, much less discussing\nthe merits of policies. The Tea\nParty\'s primary concern was\ncultural purification -- freedom\nfrom, not freedom to. Against the\ndark image of the president and\nhis liberal allies, Tea Party\nactivists defined themselves as\nthe children of light. The racial\nsubtext was always transparent.\nThe Tea Party\'s strategy rested on\na guerrilla campaign of chaos and\nsabotage designed not only to\nintimidate Democrats but also to\ndisorient independent voters who\nmight have supported health care\nreform. The Tea Partiers were\nconvinced this would be an easy\nfeat, since they believed the\nmajority of the country was on\ntheir side -- that they represented\nthe "Real America." At the 9-12\nrally Matt Kibbe, one of the\nmarch organizers, told the crowd\nthat ABC News was reporting\nthat 1 million to 1.5 million\npeople were in attendance,\nsomething ABC denied, saying\n"ABCNews.com reported an\napproximate figure of 60,000 to\n70,000 protesters." Then Armey\nled the crowd in a chant of\n"Freedom works! Freedom\nworks!" Unknown to most of the\nTea Partiers, they were intoning\nthe name of a corporate-funded\nBeltway advocacy group, not the\nbattle cry of Mel Gibson William\nWallace in Braveheart.\nContrary to its image as a\ngrassroots movement mobilized\nto stifle the machinations of\nWashington elites, the Tea Party\nmovement was the creation of a\nconstellation of industry-funded\nconservative groups with close\nRepublican ties. The movement\'s\nleading puppet-master was Dick\nArmey, who directed resources\nand talking points to the Tea\nParty "Patriots" from his\nWashington, D.C.-based\nadvocacy group, FreedomWorks.\nAmong the corporate clients of\nArmey\'s lobbying firm, which he\nwas forced to leave as a result of\nhis involvement in the Tea\nParties, was the pharmaceutical\ngiant Bristol Myers Squibb, a\ncompany with a clear interest in\ndefeating health care reform.\n(Armey\'s other "real American"\nclients included the Marxist terror\ncult, People\'s Mojahedin of Iran,\nwhich received funding and\nassistance from Saddam Hussein\nin order to launch terrorist strikes\nthroughout the 1990\'s against\nIranian civilian targets.) Armey\ncollected a consulting fee of\n$250,000 directly from\nFreedomWorks and $300,000\nfrom allied astroturf front groups.\nFreedomWorks paid out much of\nits money to an assortment of\nRepublican political consultants.\nIf Armey was the Tea Party king,\nSarah PalM was eager to be\ncrowned the Tea Party queen.\nJust days after Obama\'s\ninauguration, Palin abruptly quit\nher job as Alaskan governor to\nvie for the honor. PalM\'s motives\nfor quitting became clear when\nshe inked a lucrative deal to write\nher political memoir Going\nRogue, signed on as a regular\ncontributor to Fox News, and\nreceived $1 million an episode for\na reality show on cable television,\n"Sarah Palin\'s Alaska." PalM\'s\nbook tour, which sent her through\nMiddle America in a luxuriously\noutfitted bus, resembled both a\npresidential campaign and a\ntraveling carnival.\nWhether or not PalM intends to\nrun for president, her growing\nmedia presence has magnified her\ninfluence within the Republican\nParty. Yet the ever-expanding\nPalin phenomenon was greeted\nwith hostility by Republican\npoliticos desperately seeking to\nexpand the party\'s base after the\ndrubbing in 2008. Former\nMcCain campaign manager Steve\nSchmidt warned that Palin\'s\nnomination in 2012 would be\n"catastrophic" for the GOP. His\ndoomsday prediction was backed\nby an October Gallup poll\nrevealing her as one of the most\npolarizing and unpopular political\nfigures in the country with a\ndisapproval rating of over 50\npercent. Unfortunately for\nSchmidt and other party\npragmatists, those who approve\nof Palin represent the heartbeat of\nthe Republican Party, its most\nfervent activists, and cannot be\ndissuaded from following her,\neven if she is leading the party off\na cliff.\nA November 2009 special\ncongressional election in New\nYork\'s heavily Republican 23rd\ndistrict was the first major test of\nPalin\'s power. Along with a\nparade of nationally recognized\nconservatives, Palin endorsed\nDoug Hoffman, an unknown far-\nright third-party candidate closely\nallied with the Tea Party, helping\nto force a popular moderate\nRepublican politician, Dede\nScozzafava, from the race. In the\nend, Palin\'s ideological purge in\nupstate New York led to an\nimprobable Democratic victory,\nthe first in that district in more\nthan 100 years. After the disaster\nPalin and her allies claimed\nvictory, insisting they had at least\nhastened the purge of\nideologically impure Republicans\nfrom the party. She went on to\nendorse Rand Paul, the son of\nright-wing libertarian Rep. Ron\nPaul and a candidate in\nKentucky\'s GOP senatorial\nprimary, while Dick Cheney went\nout of his way to endorse Rand\'s\nregular Republican opponent,\nTrey Grayson, the Kentucky\nsecretary of state.\nFollowing the Tea Party script of\navoiding social issues like\nabortion and gay marriage in\norder to obscure the large\npresence of the Christian Right\nwithin the movement\'s ranks, the\nself-described "hardcore pro-\nlifer" Palin recast herself as a\nlibertarian concerned primarily\nwith issues of "economic\nfreedom." She claimed the\nDemocratic "cap and trade" plan\nto limit carbon emissions would\nharm the livelihood of blue-collar\nworkers, and she assailed health\ncare reform as a Trojan Horse for\n"socialism" (though she admitted\nher family "used to hustle over\nthe border" to take advantage of\nCanada\'s single-payer health care\nsystem). But no Palin attack had\nas much effect as the one she\nblasted out on her Facebook page\nclaiming the Obama health care\nplan included a provision for\n"death panels" that would\nrecommend euthanasia for\nseverely ill patients like her\nDown syndrome-afflicted son,\nTrig. With the click of a button,\nPalin transformed the tone of the\nhealth care debate from rancorous\nto poisonous.\nThe source of Palin\'s "death\npanels" smear was a practiced\npropagandist, former New York\nLieutenant Governor Betsy\nMcCaughey. When President Bill\nClinton introduced health care\nreform during his first term,\nMcCaughey falsely claimed in an\narticle published in the New\nRepublic and widely circulated by\nRepublicans, that the plan would\nforce consumers to drop their\nprivate plans and buy into the\ngovernment\'s program (the article\nwould go on to win a National\nMagazine Award and then be\nretracted years later by the New\nRepublic\'s editors). Now she was\nback in the spotlight, pushing a\nrumor that would be voted by the\nnon-partisan fact-checking Web\nsite Politifact.com as "the lie of\n2009." McCaughey\'s latest\ninnuendo was boosted by the cult\nof political crank Lyndon\nLaRouche, which mobilized to\npush the rumor into the\nmainstream.\nIn June 2009, one of LaRouche\'s\ntop lieutenants publicly\nconfronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the\nNational Institute of Health\'s\nchief bioethicist and brother of\nWhite House chief of staff Rahm\nEmanuel, accusing him of\nseeking to reintroduce Hitler\'s T-\n4 program to kill the handicapped\nthrough health care reform.\n"President Obama has put in\nplace a reform apparatus reviving\nthe euthanasia of Hitler Germany\nin 1939, that began the genocide\nthere," LaRouche staffer Anton\nChaitkin charged. Soon,\nLaRouche\'s followers were on\nstreet corners around the country\nwith posters depicting Obama\nwith a Hitler moustache. At a\ntown hall forum on health care\nreform hosted by Democratic\nRep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche\nfollower waved one of the\nObama-as-Hitler posters and\ndemanded, "Why do you continue\nto support a Nazi policy, as\nObama has expressly supported\nthis policy?"\nTwo months later, after Palin\nwhispered the rumor on\nFacebook, prominent\nconservatives from former\nSpeaker of the House Newt\nGingrich to ranking Senate\nFinance Committee member\nCharles Grassley parroted her\nclaims before audiences of\nindignant Tea Partiers. Not to be\noutdone, Glenn Beck devoted an\nextended rant on his show to the\nreality of death panels. Echoing\nthe LaRouche cultists, Beck\naccused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the\ndevaluing of human life, putting a\nprice on each individual." He\nthundered, "The death panel is\nnot a firing squad. Rationing is\ninevitable and they know it!"\nThe death panel rumor served a\nvariety of functions, all useful to\nthe movement, but not necessarily\nto the Republican Party. Most\nimportantly, the rumor resonated\nboth with hard-core libertarians\nwho resented the very existence\nof the federal government and\nChristian Right activists who\nviewed the legalization of\nabortion as a slippery slope to\ngovernment-sponsored\neuthanasia. The hysteria it\nengendered helped repair the rift\nexposed by the Terri Schiavo\ncharade in 2005, when the\nevangelical conservative James\nDobson publicly clashed with\nArmey, the libertarian leader,\nover the right of the government\nto interfere in a private family\nmatter of life and death.\nThe slurring of Obama as a sort\nof sleeper agent crypto-Muslim\nhelped bring the neoconservatives\nback into the fray. The new neo-\ncon generation was led by Dick\nCheney\'s daughter, Liz, who\nfounded an anti-Obama advocacy\ngroup, Keep America Safe, by\nleveraging donations from pro-\nIsrael sources. Asked by CNN\'s\nLarry King about the Birther\nmovement that was challenging\nObama\'s status as an American\ncitizen, Liz Cheney remarked,\n"One of the reasons you see\npeople so concerned about this is\npeople are uncomfortable with\nhaving for the first time ever, I\nthink, a president who seems so\nreluctant to defend the nation\noverseas." With the libertarians,\nChristian Right, and the neo-cons\nseated around the same table,\nunited in resentment of the alien\npresident, the conservative\nmovement was whole again.\nThe experiments in "Terror\nManagement Theory" of Sheldon\nSolomon, professor of\npsychology at Skidmore College,\nJeff Greenberg, professor of\npsychologist at the Unviersity of\nArizona, and Tom Pyszczynski,\nprofessor of psychology at the\nUniversity of Colorado, have\ndemonstrated the connection\nbetween fear of death and\nintensification of conservative\nattitudes. The findings help\nexplain the effectiveness of the\ndeath panel rumor and\ninsinuations by conservative\nfigures that Obama was not truly\nAmerican and somehow\nsympathetic to Islamic terrorists.\nIndeed, these seemingly irrational\nsmears were guided by tactical\nreasoning, calculated to agitate\nvoters with constant reminders of\ntheir own mortality. Whether or\nnot Independents responded, the\nrhetoric of death kept the Tea\nParty crowd in a persistent state\nof panic and rage, ensuring a\nstanding army ready to fan out to\nrallies and town halls at the first\nsign of liberal malfeasance.\nObama\'s first year in office was\nmarked by more than raucous\nprotests; there were several\ndisturbing murders committed by\nfar-right extremists. In April\n2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi\nwannabe named Richard\nPoplawsi mowed down a SWAT\nteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing\nthree. Poplawski\'s best friend told\nreporters the young killer "grew\nangry recently over fears Obama\nwould outlaw guns." Later it was\ndiscovered that Poplawski had\nposted a video clip to a neo-Nazi\nWeb site portraying Fox\'s Glenn\nBeck contemplating the existence\nof concentration camps. (After a\ncharacteristically thorough\ninvestigation, Beck conceded\nthey were not real.) On another\noccasion, the killer posted a video\npromoting Tea Party rallies. A\nmonth after the Pittsburgh\nbloodbath, Scott Roeder, a\nsupporter of the militant anti-\nabortion group Operation Rescue,\nshot Dr. George Tiller to death\nwhile he prayed at his church in\nWichita, Kansas. Tiller was\ndeclared fair game by the anti-\nabortion movement because of\nhis role as Kansas\'s only late-term\nabortion provider. During at least\n28 episodes of Bill O\'Reilly\'s\n"O\'Reilly Factor," O\'Reilly had\nreferred to Tiller as "Tiller the\nbaby killer," a criminal guilty of\n"Nazi stuff." "I wouldn\'t want to\nbe [Tiller] if there is a Judgment\nDay," O\'Reilly proclaimed.\nIn August 2009, a middle-aged\nprofessional named George\nSodini walked into a health club\nin suburban Pittsburgh and\ngunned down three women. The\nmainstream press explained\nSodini\'s motives away by homing\nin on passages in his online\ndiaries describing his loneliness,\ninability to convince women to\nhave sex with him, and descent\ninto chronic masturbation. Nearly\nevery major media outlet omitted\nor ignored a long deranged entry\nin which Sodini projected his\nsexual frustration onto Obama,\nwhom he seemed to view as a\nsymbol of black male virility and\npredation.\nThe day after Obama\'s election\nvictory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck\nto Obama! He will be successful.\nThe liberal media LOVES him.\nAmerika has chosen The Black\nMan. Good! In light of this I got\nideas outside of Obama\'s plans\nfor the economy and such. Here it\nis: Every black man should get a\nyoung white girl ... Kinda a\nreverse indentured servitude\nthing. Every daddy know when\nhe sends his little girl to college,\nshe be ... real good. I saw it. \'Not\nmy little girl\', daddy says! (Yeah\nright!!) Black dudes have thier\n[sic] choice of best white??\n[ellipses in original]."\nIn another posting to an anti-\nClinton forum in 1994, during the\nheight of the Republicans\'\nWhitewater investigation, Sodini\nrevealed that he had purchased a\nbumper sticker reading, "Stop\nSocialism, Impeach Clinton,"\nfrom a National Review ad. A\nyear later, Sodini ranted on an\nanti-government militia site, "I\nam convinced that more drastic\naction is required to bring the\ncountry back to the Constitutional\norder that it was 200 years ago. I\ndon\'t think any group of political\nleaders will achieve this for us."\nWhether or not Sodini\'s murder\nspree was motivated by his\npolitical passions, he was\npathologically death-driven and\nfixated on the phantasmagoria of\nright-wing imagery. In his final\ndiary entry, Sodini proclaimed,\n"Death lives!"\nMore than any other media figure\nof the Obama era, Glenn Beck\nencouraged the campaign of\nracial demonization and\nconspiracy that consumed the Tea\nParty "Patriots." During a\nbroadcast of "Fox and Friends,"\nBeck opined that Obama "has\nexposed himself over and over\nand over again as a guy who has a\ndeep-seated hatred for white\npeople, or the white culture." As\nevidence, Beck pointed to White\nHouse green-jobs czar Van Jones,\nan African American former\ncommunity organizer who was\neventually forced to resign as a\ndirect result of Beck\'s crusade.\nFrom there, Beck targeted another\nblack Obama adviser, Valerie\nJarrett, highlighting her ties to\nACORN while upholding her and\nJones as evidence of Obama\'s\n"socialist" agenda. In another\nbroadcast, Beck played an audio\nclip of unidentified African\nAmericans referring to "Obama\nmoney" as they collected welfare\nchecks in Detroit. Then he\nshowed footage of members of a\nKansas City-based youth group\npracticing a step show, a\ntraditional African-American\ngroup dance apparently\nunfamiliar enough to Beck and\nhis transfixed audience that he\nfelt at liberty to claim the footage\nas evidence that "Obama\'s SS"\nwas being trained across inner-\ncity America.\nIn September 2009, Beck\nrelentlessly targeted ACORN, the\nRight\'s new favorite hobgoblin,\nadmitting that he intended to use\nthe poor people\'s advocacy group\nto distract his viewers from the\nhealth care debate. "Trust me,"\nBeck said, "Everybody now says\nthey\'re going to be talking about\nhealth care. I don\'t think so." (His\nstatement was reminiscent of\nRush Limbaugh\'s scandal-\nmongering remark during the\nearly Clinton administration:\n"Whitewater is about health\ncare.") Beck promptly cued up a\nseries of hidden camera videos\nshot by conservative youth\nactivists James O\'Keefe and\nHannah Giles inside ACORN\nfield offices. In the videos,\nO\'Keefe baited African-American\nstaffers into making statements\nexplaining that Giles, who\nclaimed she was a prostitute,\ncould obtain low-income housing.\nO\'Keefe edited in images of\nhimself clad in an outlandish\npimp costume to create the\nimpression that he was dressed\nthat way during the meetings with\nACORN; however, Giles later\nadmitted her partner had lied\nabout wearing his costume to\nfarther ineriminate ACORN. In\nthe end. ACORN was exonerated\nof all criminal wrongdoing while\nin a separate incident O\'Keefe\nwas arrested and charged with a\nfederal crime after he and several\nconservative pals disguised\nthemselves as telephone\nrepairmen and attempted to\nwiretap phone lines in the office\nof Senator Mary \'Landrieu of\nLouisiana. Like Ryan Sorba,\nO\'Keefe and his posse were\nmovement cadres paid and\ndirected by well-funded\nconservative outfits; O\'Keefe had\nbeen trained by the Leadership\nInstitute, the right-wing youth\nFroup that nurtured leadinG, lights\nlike Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove,\nRalph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.\nWhile O\'Keefe and his buddies\nplea-bargained with prosecutors,\nBeck basked in his formula for\nsuccess. His show earned the\nhithest ratings at Fox News,\ntopping network franchises like\nO\'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the\nprocess. Beck\'s opinions became\nfirmly implanted in the nervous\nsystems of Tea Party activists.\n"Glenn Beck has taught us\neverything we know," a\ndemonstrator at the 9-12 rally told\nMe. "He\'s opened our eyes to so\nmuch."\nBut unlike the right-wing radio\nwarhorses who helped usher in\nNewt Gin<trich\'s Republican\ncounter-revolution of 1994, Beck\nwas not an authentic product of\nthe movement. When Rush\nLimbaugh first began dominating\nthe AM airwaves, Beck was\nmired in the world of mid-level\ncommercial radio, delivering\ncorny yarns about lesbians and\ncelebrity trash in hopes of\nbecoming the next Howard Stem.\nBy night, as he has tirelessly\nrecounted, he medicated his\nanxiety with cocaine and alcohol,\ndestroying his first marriage in\nthe process. "We remember\nGlenn from the womanizing, the\ndrinking, the drugs. Everybody\nwho knew him at the time saw\nwhat a: complete mess he was," a\nshock jock from Tampa, Florida,\nwho called himself Bubba the\nLove Sponge remarked to me\nduring a broadcast of his\nnationally syndicated show.\nLike Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-\npopulist demagogue of Elia\nKazan\'s 1957 film, A Face in the\nCrowd. Beck was a self-\ndestructive drifter Who might\nhave been crumpled up with a\nbottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an\nalleyway or been locked away in\n,a prison cell had fame not found\nhim first. Beck was only able to\nstabilize his life when he made\nhis escape from freedom.,\nmarrying a conservative Mormon,\nconverting to her religion, and\ntransmuting his urge to abuse\ndrugs into conservative radio\ndiatribes. When Beck first broke\ninto television On CNN\'s\nHeadline News Channel, he\nstruggled to articulate a coherent\npolitical world view. If he\ndistinguished himself from other\nbig-time conservative .hosts in\nany way, he did so through\nstrained and often snide attempts\nat humor, remnants of his failed\nradio career. Nevertheless, with\nhelp from his liberal agent,\nMatthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a\nprimetime slot at Fox News in\nearly 2009. Around this same\ntime, Beck began promoting the\nwork of an arcane Mormon\nconspiracy-peddler named W.\nClean Skousen, whom he\ndescribed as his political lodestar.\nSuddenly, Beck had something\nmore to offer than irritable mental\ngestures.\nThanks to Beck\'s designation of\nSkousen\'s pseudohistorical tract\nThe 5000 Year Leap as "required\nreading" on the Web site of his 9-\n12 Project, and his promotion of\nthe book on his show, the\npreviously obscure Skousen.\nbecame the Hidden imam of the\nTea Party movement. By the\nsummer of 2009, Skousen\'s Leap\nwas among the top 10 books on\nAmazon.com and a fixture on\nliterature tables at Tea Party\ngatherings. It went from selling a\npuny couple of thousand copies in\n2007 to selling over 200,000\ncopies in 2009. Just why the book\ngenerated such an instant appeal\nis difficult to understand. It is\nlittle more than a slapdash of\nquotes from the Founding\nFathers, often taken out of\ncontext and deliberately\noversimplified, to explain why\nAmerica is the greatest nation in\nhistory. in the process, Skousen\nclaims that church and state\nseparation is un-American, that\n"coercive taxation" is communist,\nand that marriage is the\nunderpinning of a free society.\nBenjamin Franklin., who wrote at\nlength on the merits of "amours"\nwith "old women," and who\nfamously solicited prostitutes and\nfathered a son of out of wedlock,\nwas the ultimate authority\nSkousen quoted on the\nimportance of marriage.\nThough Skousen claims the\nFounders as the world\'s foremost\nsource of eternal wisdom, he\nbuttressed his points with fringe\nsources like the conspiracist\nNorman Dodd\'s screeds about the\nIlluminati. According. to Skousen,\nDodd claimed that "powerful\ninfluences congregating in the\nUnited States" like the\nRockefellers and the Rothschilds\nhad forced the United States into\nWorld War I. Skousen published\nDodd\'s manifestoes in his obscure\njournal Freemen\'s Digest, which\nhe founded for the express\npurpose of propagating\nconspiracies.\nSkousen\'s paranoid politics were\nan outgrowth of his participation.\nin extreme anti-communist\ngroups during the 1950s. He\nboasted of a close friendship with\nthen-FBI director J. Edgar\nHoover and said he provided him\nwith research on communist\nplots, claims disputed by FBI\nhistorians. (During a recent\ninterview. Skousen\'s son, Paul,\ntold me that contrary to rumors of\nHoover\'s cross-dressing and\nhomosexual dalliances, he would\nset the top cop up on blind dates\nwith live women.) Skousen was\nfired from his job as Salt Lake\nCity\'s police chief for, in the\nwords of the city\'s conservative\nMormon mayor, "conduct[ing]\nhi.s office as chief of police in\nexactly the same manner in which\nthe communists operate their\ngovernment." From there,\nSkousen sailed off to the far\nshores of the Right-peddling\nconspiracy tracts like The Naked\nCommunist-, and earning\ncondemnation from his beloved\nFBI, which accused him in an\ninternal memo of "promoting\n[his] own anti-communism for\nobvious financial purposes."\nSkousen\'s vocal support for the\nfar-right John Birch Society\'s\nclaim that communists controlled\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower\ncost him the support of the\ncorporate backers who had paid\nfor his Red-bashing lecture tours.\nHe went off the radar for several\nyears, returning during the late\n1960s to accuse the Jewish\nRothschild family of secretly\nbankrolling everyone from Ho\nChi Minh to the civil rights.\nmovement. By the late 1970s,\neven the Church of Latter Day\nSaints distanced itself from\nSkousen and his conspiracy\ntheories. His work fell through\nthe margins and might have\ndisappeared entirely had Beck not\nrevived it, turning The 5000 Year\nLeap into the bible of the Tea\nParty movement. Journalist\nAlexander Zaitchik observed in\nhis authoritative profile of\nSkousen on Salon.com that\nSkousen\'s renewed influence\nthrough Beck and the Tea Party\n\'suggests that the modern base of\nthe Republican Party is headed to\na very strange place."\nBesides influencing Beck,\nSkousen\'s teachings inspired one\nof the Tea Party movement\'s most\nvisible grassroots celebrities,\nretired Sheriff Richard Mack. I\nmet Mack in February at a far-\nright rally just outside of\nMontgomery, Alabama. On a\nmakeshift stage towed into the\nmiddle of a rodeo arena by a\npickup truck, Mack recalled with\nreverence his mentorship by\nSkousen, who he said taught him\neverything he needed to know\nabout the Constitution. Mack\nurged his spellbound audience to\nstockpile ammo and store food.\n"If you control the food supply,"\nMack warned, "you control the\npeople. And that\'s the first step to\nslavery."\nAlready a hero to conservatives\nfor successfully suing the Clinton\nadministration over the provision\nin the Brady Handgun Violence\nPrevention Act requiring law\nenforcement to conduct criminal\nbackground checks of gun\npurchasers, Mack reemerged in\nthe Obama era as the archetypal\nlocal lawman who vowed to resist\nthe tyrannical federal\ngovernment. Along with a few\ndozen former and active military\nand law enforcement personnel,\nMack helped form a self-styled\nTea Party militia called the\nOathkeepers. Galvanized by their\nfear of creeping socialism, the\nOathkeepers solemnly swore to\nrefuse tyrannical federal orders\nsuch as cooperating with foreign\ntroops and forcing Americans\ninto concentration camps.\nBecause the group\'s members\ntrained for combat, the vow came\nwith suggestion of armed\nresistance.\nBesides Mack, the Oathkeepers\nattracted a coterie of militia\nmovement retreads into its ranks.\nThe most well-established figure\nwas Mike Vanderboegh, a\nlongtime militia fanatic who\npublished a booklet in the mid-\n1990s entitled Strategy and\nTactics for a Militia Civil War,\ncalling for sniper attacks on "war\ncriminals, secret policemen, rats."\nWith Obama in office,\nVandeboegh churned out anti-\ngovernment screeds on right-wing\nblogs with renewed passion and\nsupported his efforts by cashing\nin the $1,300 in federal disability\ncompensation he received each\nmonth.\nFor all the energy the far right\nexerted in its campaign to\nstrangle Obama\'s agenda, it was a\nDemocrat who posed the greatest\nthreat to the passage of health\ncare reform. Representative Bart\nStupak of Michigan had been in\noffice since 1993, placing him\namong the senior leadership of\nthe so-called centrist Blue Dog\nDemocrats. When health care\nreform was introduced in\nCongress, Stupak became the\nleader of an informal caucus of\nanti-abortion Democrats, making\nhim the de facto swing vote on\nthe House version of the bill. By\nextension, Stupak was the point\nman in the campaign to ensure\nthat the bill would not allow\nfederal funding for abortion for\nlow-income women.\nBut after close consultation with\nleaders of the U.S. Conference of\nCatholic Bishops, Stupak went a\nstep further. He introduced a\ndraconian amendment to block\nwomen from paying for abortions\nfrom even their own private\ninsurance plans. The amendment,\nwhich passed the House but was\nshut down in the Senate, became\na key sticking point in health care\nnegotiations. \'He\'s a big hero\nnow in the pro-life community,"\nformer Bush Catholic issues\nadviser Deal Hudson told me in\nNovember 2009. "Thanks to him,\nthis is the first time I can\nremember the pro-life Democrats\nhaving any power."\nTo the chagrin of the\nRepublicans, Stupak entertained\noffers of compromise from the\nDemocratic leadership.\nAccording to Hudson, the\nCatholic Bishops were keen to\nsee health care reform pass, but\nonly if the bill contained a clear\nprovision forbidding patients\nfrom spending federal money on\nabortion. Finally, in March, after\npressure from House Majority\nLeader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a\nagreed to sign an executive order\nforbidding the federal funding of\nabortion. Stupak had been\nmollified. Now he and his anti-\nabortion caucus pledged to\ndeliver the swing votes the\nDemocrats needed to pass the\nbill. As soon as reports seeped out\ndeclaring the imminent passage\nof health care reform, major\nright-wing blogs like\nRedState.org churned out virulent\ndenunciations of Stupak, calling\nhim a traitor and sellout. The blog\ncomment sections filled up with\ndozens of diatribes referring to\nStupak in language previously\nreserved for Dr. George Tiller:\n"Bart the Baby-Killer."\nOn March 20, thousands of Tea\nParty activists surrounded the\nCapitol\'s Longworth Building in\nexpectation of Obama\'s pep talk\nto the House Democrats and the\nhealth care vote. Democratic\nRepresentative john Lewis, a\nhero of the civil rights movement,\nand Representative Barney Frank,\nthe first openly gay member of\nCongress, passed through the\ncrowd on their way inside the\nCapitol. Thsligger!" a demonstrator\nbarked at Lewis. Another called\nFrank a "faggot," eliciting\nlaughter and cheers from nearby\nprotesters. Meanwhile, as another\nAfrican-American Democrat,\nRepresentative Emanuel Cleaver,\nascended the Capitol steps, a\nprotester who had been screaming\nat Lewis and Frank spat on his\nface.\nWith the demonstration carried\non into the night, cries of "Kill\nthe bill!\'\' drifted into calls for\nviolence. "I would gladly stand\nwith any of you men here and\ntake these fascists down," a man\nin camouflage battle dress\nuniform proclaimed in front of an\namateur videographer, pointing\ntoward the Capitol. "You haven\'t\nheard the last of me!"\nThe next day, Republican\nmembers of Congress emerged\nfrom the Longworth Building to\nsalute the Tea Partiers. The\ndemonstrators cheered wildly for\ntheir proxies on the inside.\nFinally, after hours of\nimpassioned speeches on the\nHouse floor, the bill passed. But\nthe drama was hardly over.\nRepublican Representative Joe\nPitts, an anti-abortion Catholic\nwho co-authored Stupak\'s\noriginal amendment, demanded a\nmotion to bring it back to the\nfloor for a vote, a transparent\nexercise in grandstanding that\nwas certain to fail. In response,\nStupak rushed to the podium with\na stinging rebuke to Pitts and the\nRepublicans. "The motion to\ncommit does not support life,"\nStupak declared. "It is the\nDemocrats who have stood up...."\nHeckling from the Republican\nside interrupted his statement. As\nStupak looked around the House\nchamber, Rep. Randy\nNeugebauer, a right-wing\nRepublican from Texas who\nopenly supported the Birther\nmovement, began shouting at him\nfrom the backbench, "Baby\nkiller!" Other Republicans joined\nin, parroting base insults.\nWhile the Republicans sank their\nheads in defeat, some more\nmilitant devotees of the Tea Party\nmovement called for a right-wing\nKristallnacht. "If you wish to\nsend a message that Pelosi and\nher party cannot fail to hear,\nbreak their windows,"\nVanderboegh of the Oathkeepers\nwrote on a far-right blog hours\nafter the bill passed. "Break them\nNOW. Break them and run to\nbreak again." Within three days,\nwindows and doors at Democratic\nParty headquarters in New York,\nKansas and Arizona had been\nshattered.\nMeanwhile, at least 10\nDemocratic members of Congress\nreported receiving death threats.\nImages of nooses were faxed to\nthe offices of Stupak and James\nClyburn, an African-American\ncongressman from South\nCarolina. Representative Anthony\nWeiner, an especially vocal\nproponent of health care reform,\nreceived a menacing letter filled\nwith white powder. The brother\nof Representative Torn Perriello,\nanother health care supporter, had\nhis home gas line deliberately\nsabotaged after a local Tea Party\norganizer posted his address\nonline (he had meant to post the\ncongressman\'s) and encouraged\nactivists to "drop by" to express\ntheir anger about Perriello\'s\nrecent vote. In Tucson, Arizona,\nthe windows of Democratic\nRepresentative Gabrielle\nGiffbrds\' office were shattered by\nshots from a pellet gun. And a\nbrick was thrown through the\nwindow of Representative Louise\nSlaughter\'s office in New York as\nher voicemail filled with threats\nof impending sniper attacks.\nAfter the Passage of the health\ncare bill, the Tea Party floated\ninto a gray zone between\nauthoritarianism and anarchy.\nCrusading to restore a holy social\norder, they promoted disorder.\nClaiming to protect democracy,\nthey smashed windows of elected\nrepresentatives. Warning of death\npanels, they called in death\nthreats. With the atmosphere of\nviolence thickening, Palin took to\nher Twitter account to issue a\nbattle cry: "Don\'t Retreat,\nInstead—RELOAD!" Thus\nconcluded the first phase of the\nObama era that was to usher in a\npeaceable kingdom of\nbipartisanship.\nMax Blumenthal is the author of\nRepublican GOmorrah\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009).\nContact him at\nax biumenth f..7,13 000(41vahoo.com.\nC 2010 Nation Books All rights\nreserved.\nView this story online at:\nhttp://www.alternetorgistory/147784/',)
("Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over the\npast several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the\nneed for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But\nthe more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in\norder to maximize chances of diplomatic success.\nI. . State of Play\nAs the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series\nof tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality.\n1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to\ndirect talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as\nexisting substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles\nwill have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been\nresolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks.\na. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium?\nb. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter\nbetween the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that\ncovers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS)\nthat outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton\nparameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of\nprinciples?\nc. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present\nin all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for\nallowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at\nleast for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.?\nd. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it\npresent bridging proposals and, if so, when?\ne. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the\ndirect talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the\nU.S. and Israel on the other?\nBeyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to\nremain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how\ndifficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally;\nhow fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom,\nwe have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever\nreach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not\nknow himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the\nurgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo.\nAssuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the\nPalestinians, this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom he\nlikes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver.\nRather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S.\nadministration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of the\nagreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and\ninternational recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S.\nhelp, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically.\nGetting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Other\nbasic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli\npublic and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal without\nwhich Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But the\npoint is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince the\nprime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- to\nmake the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, it\nwill be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians.\n2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the\nU.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of\nthe domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoral\nreasons, but because the U.S.'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for\na deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has been\nimproved to some extent as a result of the successful July visit by Netanyahu and the\nstring of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest:\nthere sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new,\npotentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeli\nprime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime\nminister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones.\n3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot by\nhimself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions,\nboth Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom\nthey would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-day\nnegotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players they\nperceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton\nAdministration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role going\nforward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement.\nThe president faces a different but no less difficult problem. He is not trusted in\nIsrael and, though the July meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, not\ntrusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which\nreflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct his\neffectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned during\nWJC's presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in\nnegotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expend\nthe political capital prematurely. To do so, moreover, would automatically be to\ndevalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a whole\nexcessively dependent on his involvement.\nYour Role\nUnder these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and\npotentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be\nthe day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not\nrecommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I\ndescribed above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures.\nNor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which\nwould quickly depreciate your value.\nRather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could\nfill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the\nneed both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable\ncredibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared\nto deal substantively with Obama and with you).\nYour role would be twofold\n1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large\ndegree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further explored\nand he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know\nhis zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited\nto begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns,\nhow they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end\nof the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs\nare met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level\nU.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and\nwork with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding\nthat would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require\nbeing tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the\nmilitarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan\nValley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is\nthat without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he\nhas to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere.\nTo repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel,\nreinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu\nat periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time.\n2. To help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among important\ndomestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so\nhere and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama\nmust contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would\nseek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what\nbenefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure\nand recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the\nconflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international\nlegitimacy.\nIII. Potential Downsides and Responses\n1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated\nmeetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the\nnature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This\nwould be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between\ndiscussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of\nthat outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract\nfrom Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on\nthe Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and\nminimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective\nnegotiators work out the details\n2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating\nthe sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides\npotentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for\nthe reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining\nsomewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this\nprocess could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying\nit. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of\nyou will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that\nreflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and\nclearer mandate than currently is the case.\n3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most\nsignificant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility.\nPalestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming\nsuccessions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which\nwe most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and\nhis heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better\noff keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on\nyour plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons:\na. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated\nwith a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and\nbeing criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it.\nb. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the\nregion; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the\nsettlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind\nof involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has\nappeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed\nwhen it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in\norder to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has\nserved you well.\nc. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an\nagreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively\nto bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical\ncompromise are outweighed by its benefits.\nd. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all\nlikelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a\npeacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the\npeace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gone\nin smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and\nthe U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional\nclimate.",)
('sbwhoeop\nWednesday, August 25, 2010 10:52 AM\nworth reading, even if you know the Intel\nB6\nH: I\'m sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece, how Mullah Omar was saved by ISI, for example, but the idea\nof Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sid\nhttp://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistan\niNT aLOSE\nThe military and the mullahs\nWilliam Dalrymple\nPublished 23 August 2010\nThe Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India.\nIt is proving a fatal alliance.\nIt May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the country\'s inscrutable chief of\narmy staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.\nFor a start, the army\'s response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistan\'s civilian\npoliticians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed\n"Mr 10 Per Cent"; he has now been upgraded to "Mr 110 Per Cent"). This has led to discussion in army circles about\nwhether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this\nthreat, that one of the country\'s most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday\nTimes, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup."( know this is\ndefinitely being discussed," he said.\nThen there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: "an extraordinary\nsituation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it", explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper.\nKayani, a former head of Pakistan\'s notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue\nto run the army, and by default Pakistan\'s foreign policy, until November 2013.\nBut Kayani\'s biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured\nguest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which\nhave been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh,\nKarzai\'s pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a\nmujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed "Lion of Panjshir". The Taliban, and their sponsors in\nthe ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of.\nWhen I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzai\'s\ngovernment in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its\npuppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Saleh\'s sacking gave notice of an important change of direction\nby Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obama\'s Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, "it means that Karzai is already\nplanning for a post-American Afghanistan". •\nIt seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI-\nsponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun\nsouth to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India,\nPakistan\'s great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top\npriority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power.\nWith the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistan\'s influence disappeared abruptly from\nAfghanistan and\nIndia quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISI\'s horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction\nassistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament\nand free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General\nStanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, "while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian\ninfluence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures".\nMcChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. "We\nhave strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistan\'s interests to destabilise Pakistan," a foreign\nministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan\'s military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging\nto the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a\npotential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital\n"strategic depth".\nAccording to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian\ndiplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk\nPakistan\'s relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under\nISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai\'s new deal with the Pakistanis, and his\nclear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major\nstrategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan\'s military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India.\nPakistan\'s support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi\nmovements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan\'s army saw violent Islamic\ngroups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the\nretreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed\nwith great effect from 1990 onwards).\nThe former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy,\nonce said to me: "If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a\nlegitimate cause, why should we not support them?" Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin\nWall presented to him by the city\'s people for "delivering the first blow" to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in\nthe 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his "retirement".\nThe Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped\nconversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India\nreleased in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their "tooti" (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed\ntheir own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan\'s religious minorities and political leaders, but\neven the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against\nIndian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so\nmuch as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state.\nThe army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public\npromises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on\nplans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai\'s\nregime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul\nonce the American gaze had turned elsewhere.\nSo it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah\nMohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of\nPashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest.\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely\noutside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North\nWaziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan.\nBy 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them\na few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani\narmy officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies\nconcluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised\nfunds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani\nsupport, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned\nto their bases in Pakistan.\nAt the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the\nAfghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice\nbombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research\nand Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in\nthe blasts.\nThe degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the\ndocuments published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based\non interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! "orchestrates, sustains and\nstrongly influences" the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban\'s supreme leadership\ncouncil, the Quetta Shura.\nMeanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been\nbehind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. "The powerful\nwestern world is terrorising Muslims," he told a conference in Islamabad this year. "We are being invaded, manipulated\nand looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In\nfact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad."\nAt the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous\nassistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the\nmilitants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and\nannounced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in\nthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000\npeople were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members\nof the Afghan Taliban who didn\'t follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in-\ncommand, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as\ninfringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance.\nYet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North\nWaziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI\'s favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan\'s\nfoot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups\nin Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief\nminister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the\nPakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani\nestablishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones.\nIn their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last\nmonth, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and\nDelhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to -\nresuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban\'s takeover of the south, and here India is working\nin conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian "stans". The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon,\nwas despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American\nAfghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun\nsouth, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming\nthe north and Pakistan the south.\nAs diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to\nincrease their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful\nnorth, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the\nBritish aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result.\nIn Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly\n3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation\'s history, it regarded home-grown Islamic\nmilitants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a\nrecent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks\nthat he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan\'s economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and\nthe educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country\'s defence budget.\nIt is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in\nthe region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any\ntime soon.\nWilliam Dalrymple\'s "Nine Lives: in Search of the Sacred in Modern India" won the first Asia House Literary Award in\nMay and is newly published in paperback (Bloomsbury, £8.99)',)

After all, is this not\nwhat one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and\npersuasion?\nArabs generally think not.

('America\'s Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others?\nRemarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nand, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway\nYou have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for\npeace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi\nArabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry.\nThe declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and\nPalestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another\ndeceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called "peace process." And if that one step forward in Oslo in\n1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened.\nThere can be no doubt about the importance of today\'s topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs\nthe world\'s conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European\ncolonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by\ndegrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It\nstimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the\ninteraction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations.\nFor better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this\ncontest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in\nthe Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle\nEast thus affect much more than that region.\nYet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve\nparties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israel\'s behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional\nsupport for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a "peace\nprocess" has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are\nalternatives to tomorrow\'s diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for\npowers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land.\nOver thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypt\'s Anwar Sadat\nhad opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian\nleaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other\ngovernments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of\nany other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.\nFor more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and\nto sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of\ninternational law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American\nsupport has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the\nPalestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought\nsuccessive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace.\nIronically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political\nframework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic\ncleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive\nconfinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza.\nDespite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine\nremains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the\nregion — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for\nconflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China,\nIndia, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has\npostured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof.\nOn rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel\nwith action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S.\nsubventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude\narrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt\nof the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have\ntimorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American\nprotection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and\ncitizens.\nIslam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody\nrighteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites\' failure to meet these standards\ngenerates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments\nassociated with it.\nThe perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American\ncomplicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washington\'s protection\nof Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washington\'s response to the attack\nincluded suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and\nIraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The\narmed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other\ncountries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are\nechoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States,\nThe widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a\nmetastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the world\'s 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a\nmenace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European\nxenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers\nterrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted\ndemagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent\nillustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It\nrules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat.\nPresident Obama\'s inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into\noffice committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international\nmedia was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish\nparliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably\neloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices\nin the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious\nrecrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obama\'s sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy\nchange anyone can detect, let alone believe in\nIt is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administration\'s\nstewardship of so many aspects of my country\'s affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two\nmonths from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is\nonly part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in\nthe situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this.\nLet me begin with the "peace process," a hardy perennial of America\'s diplomatic repertoire that the Obama\nAdministration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and "even-\nhanded" American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It\nprovided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to\nstand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the\nArabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there\nhasn\'t been an American-led "peace process" in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a "peace\nprocess" became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the "peace\nprocess" had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form.\nEven when there was no "peace process," the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the\nguileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far\nfrom least — lifetime employment for career "peace processors." The perpetual processing of peace without the\nrequirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like\nmagicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their\nhomes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening\nswath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel.\nPalestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a "peace process." It\'s\nnot just that there has been no obviously better way to end their people\'s suffering. Playing "peace process" charades\njustifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied\nterritories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American\nleaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East "peace process" has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic\nworlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are\nimpatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the\ngovernment of Israel to trade land for it.\nPrevious "peace processes" have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have\nserved to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving\nit. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of\nrelentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as\nthey first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington\ntomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will.\nOne is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed\n"peace processes" to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill-\nprepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political\nauthority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President\nObama\'s political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still\nless to address each other\'s agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final\n— iteration of the perpetually ineffectual "peace process" are more fundamental.\nThe Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates\nthat: "The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign\nstate." This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has\nno interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound\nby the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the "Roadmap," or the premise of the "two-state\nsolution."\nThe Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the\nauthority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their\nstanding in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its\nauthority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains\npower by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered\nby the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbas\'s constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over\na parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his\nadministration can now speak.\nSo the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with\nthe mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international\ncredibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia,\nand the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was\npublicly humiliated by Israel\'s prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israel\'s\ncontinuing seizure and colonization of Arab land.\nVague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the "peace process" has always\nsneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year\nwas made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted\nfrom previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will\nrecall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the\ninternational community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian\nstate. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed.\nPeace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to\nimpose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality\ndirects our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these\nabsences create.\nObviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas\n— is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they\nhave nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were\nexplicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly\nfinessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile\neither American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be\nrepresented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact.\nOther Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks\ntomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest\ninstallment of the "peace process" is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and\nalso a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the\nUnited States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition\nevidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and\nAmericans.\nTo begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new "peace process" have officially acknowledged or\nresponded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel\nmake peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer,\nignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands.\nIn this connection, making Arab recognition of Israel\'s "right to exist" the central purpose of the "peace process" offends\nArabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well\nbeyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem\nto be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and\nthe manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and\naccept peace?\nArabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a\nhomeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of\nPalestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking\nthem to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they\nrecognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israel\'s unilateral\nexpansion at Palestinian expense.\nThe lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns\nabout Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S.\npeace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of\nacceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace.\nEach time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with\nincredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washington\'s sympathy and solicitude for Israelis\nand its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement\nof Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a "peace process" in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of\ncarrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it.\nThe effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously\nunpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of\nGeorge Mitchell\'s mandate for "peace process" diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed\nfollow-up to tomorrow\'s meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other\nArabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering.\nAs a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic\nhas two quite different words that are both translated as "negotiation," making a distinction that doesn\'t exist in either\nEnglish or Hebrew. One word, "musaawama," refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in\nbazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each\nother. Another, "mufaawadhat," describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that\ntake place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship.\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat\'s travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of\nmufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It\ncalled for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with\nintermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on\nwhich a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive.\nI cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic\neffectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands\nthings and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the\nreasons we can\'t seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we don\'t make much effort to understand\nhow others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are\nlong on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential\nmilitarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have\nforgotten how to listen to them or persuade them.\nI am not myself an "Arabist," but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the\nAmerican diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and\nempathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw\nas in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our\nMiddle East diplomacy.\nThis brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for\nwhat must be done.\nIn foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed\nEuropeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include -\nbut are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross\ninjustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as\nfriendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of\nanti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to\nthe Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians.\nArab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination\nfor Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israel\'s democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest\nin ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions\nwith the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as\nthey very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabia\'s King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue\nand the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy.\nAs the custodian of two of Islam\'s three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long\ntranscended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all\nsects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of\nreligious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure\nfreedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest\nthat Jews, Christians, and Muslims share.\nThere is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is\ngenerally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects\npathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrow\'s meeting\nmay well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the\nachievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone else\'s that\nothers become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not\nexpecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead.\nHere, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was\nhappy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them\nfrom subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected\nfrom Israel\'s ability to manipulate American politics can succeed.\nThis brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most\nAmericans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending\nthe stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to\npresent today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the\nArabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint\nor parallel action on behalf of peace.\nNow to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial.\nFirst, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted\nthan most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have\npublished some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its\ncontents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab\nLeague declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the\nArab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation\nwith them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab\nMuslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldn\'t be bad for Europe\'s relations with\nboth. By the way, given the U.S. media\'s notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a\nwell-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either.\nSecond, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who\nare empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so\nas to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace\npartner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has\nacted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity\ngovernment to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong\ndomestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some\ncircumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test.\nThird, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law\ninternationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Council\'s position at the apex of the international system has\nserved to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented\nthe application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights\nconventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the\ncollective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied\nterritory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians,\nbarred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior,\nusually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses.\nIf ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just "unhelpful" but illegal, the international community should\nfind a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization -\nits vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt\nthemselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both\nas occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General\nAssembly cannot "unite for peace" to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink\nfrom working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond\nneed to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better\nchance for peace.\nFourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN\nSecurity Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference\noutside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in\na year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference\nwould consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israel\'s 1967\nborders or recognition of Israel\'s achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring\nIsrael to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and\ndisinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the\nconsequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the\ninternational community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic\nconfrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one-\nyear deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrow\'s talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit\nimmensely from peace with the Palestinians.\nTime is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement\nactivity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israel\'s\nactions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are\ndetermined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to\nalleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage\nagainst injustice that incites terrorism.\nIt is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation\nbetween Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked\nto set the stage for a discussion of this issue.',)

Besides\nproviding a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in\nEurope by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrival\nof Vargas Llosa, one of the world\'s foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch\nmedia, the country\'s political class, and the royal family.\nEven with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants\' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right\nDutch People\'s Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With his\ngathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the government\nmeets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to the\ngovernment, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. It\nis the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategy\nof the far-right in countries across the continent.\nWilders\' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has also\ngenerated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilders\npromised to hire scores of "animal cops" to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in the\nonly country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about our\nfurry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech is\nonly for the "Judeo-Christian" community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance,\ninstituting what he called a "head rag tax" on Muslim women. Wilders\' international allies include the goosestepping neo-\nNazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang,\nand a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the most\ninfluential Islamophobe in the world.\nBut does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has just\npublished a book entitled "De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme," or "The Eternal Return of Fascism" (I eagerly await\nits English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders\' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In the\nbook, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders\' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to the\ngenocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists "one-\nand-one." In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionary\nfigures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spade\na spade. Where Wilders\' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain the\nB6\nstory will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen\'s book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies while\ngenerating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate.\nRiemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as "un-\nDutch." In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement is\nwelcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So the\nDutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed\nto have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear\nresonances of fascism in Wilders\' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulating\nthe terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able to\nsee the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen\'s indignation.\nThe symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-right\nparties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa\'s\ndifferences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo-\nliberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial\nnationalization.\nVargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy,\nparticularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to\nWestern civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to the\nMadrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular\ngroups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa\ndeclared in his speech that "Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation," and has been harshly critical of the state\nin the past).\nDuring the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of\nfamed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel\'s "vibrant democracy." She was enthusiastically seconded by Mitchell\nCohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that "the\ndominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism." I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the\nalmost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberal\ntrend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that "Geert Wilders and politicians\nlike him are not welcomed by Israelis."\nYet Wilders is one of Israel\'s most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claims\nthat his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. "Nowhere did I have the special feeling of\nsolidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport," he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch\nfinancial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settler\nmovement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionist\nintelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel\'s\nmainstream leadership echoes Wilders\' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling\nhandful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights for\nequality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within the\nIsraeli political spectrum: "The origin of terrorism is within Islam," Olmert declared this month.\nThe pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient\npolitical tactic. Of course, saying you "stand with Israel," as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself from\ncharges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest\nideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state\n— and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell;\nthey admire Israel\'s settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority\nabove all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgame\nof the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli.\nAfter the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D\'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PM\nSilvio Berlusconi\'s control over 90 percent of the country\'s media, the government\'s deep seated corruption and the Prime\nMinister\'s repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United States\nwas a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelists\nhad described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided\nthat our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest\nblows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act\nto the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D\'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he\nnever knew American media was ever regulated in the first place.\nDuring the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student asked\nwhether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa\'s address. I responded\nthat it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practice\nthe second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago political\nscientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries\nand the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do\nwith the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our time\nwas so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about\nIslam\'s inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that\nsuicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression.\nNext, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People\'s Party for\nFreedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his political\ncareer. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the "paleocon" characters\nI\'ve met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance.\n"Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90\'s with the idea of the \'good stranger,"\nBolkstein declared. "If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr.\nWilders."\nThe only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Paul\nFrissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects "the right to be fundamentalist." The\nother panelists either gave Bolkstein\'s xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. After\nBolkstein lightly criticized Wilders\' call for banning the Quran, remarking that "what he says about Islam is nonsense"\nbecause it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health, chimed in."It\'s\nnot nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours," Klink claimed.\nThen, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christian\nschools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders,\nentered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. "I\'m against all forms of religious teaching!" he proudly\nexclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. "How can you call yourself a liberal?" Frissen asked with a\ntone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him.\nDuring question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the\n"ghost of neo-colonialism," which "the African people never voted for." She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on\ndeveloping countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein\'s role as a manager at Royal Dutch\nShell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and Honduras during the 1970\'s (I\'m sure nothing unseemly\nhappened during Bo!stein\'s tenure in these places). Bolkstein\'s responded bluntly, "If these countries try to be self-\nsufficient it just doesn\'t work!"\nAfter the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They were\nappalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. "None of them knew the first thing about Islam," an Arab student\nremarked. "They couldn\'t even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe." Ginwala added, "How can Bolkstein\ntell me my country can\'t be self-sufficient? I come from India. It\'s one of the most diversified economies on the planet."\nI was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to\nwere closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20-\nsomething security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole life\nin Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York\nCity and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. "Most of us\naren\'t even religious," Muhammad said. "When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. I\'m like,\nis this guy serious?"\nBut he did not underestimate Wilders\' appeal. "Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like it\'s carefully\nplanned. He obviously knows what he\'s doing. And they let him get away with it," Muhammad remarked. "Look, I\'m just a\ncitizen, I\'m nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesn\'t like, I\'ll be punished. But\nwhen Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, more\nand more people are voting for him."',)

Sid\nFinancial Times FT.corn\nA poisoned process holds little hope\nBy David Gardner\nPublished: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46\n„\nAs the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, the\npervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming — and with good reason.\nThe Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground — in\nparticular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land — pull in the opposite direction to\npeace. "We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick," is how one Arab minister puts it, "and here we go\nagain."\nWhile many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remains\nthe continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab\nand — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon\nPeres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,\nwho wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the\noccupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.\nA decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of\ncantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roads\nlinking the settlements. Last month, B\'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now\ntaken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of\nGaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.\nThe main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace\nprocess and these — in Israeli parlance — "facts on the ground".\nAt last month\'s White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement\ninto a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader "willing to take risks for peace".\nBut there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obama\'s Cairo speech denying\nany legitimacy to Israel\'s settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words "Palestinian state" — but he\nsurrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.\nIndeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means by\nthem is different.\nThe mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet\nmade up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living\nin peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967\nArab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to\npreserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?\nHe has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on\nJerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung "ideological" ones and the 100-plus "outposts"\nestablished as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a\nsort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.\nWill he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily\nclose difficult deals? There is little to suggest that:\nThe thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist.\nWhile his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox\nparties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be\nfair, Israel\'s electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable —\nmeans lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice\nof partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.\nAs risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next\nmonth and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,\nmoreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around\nJerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with\nMr Netanyahu\'s strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel\'s eastern border.\nAs diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in\nthe occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian\nAuthority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed\nto marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.\nThe outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22\nArab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the\noccupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.\nThe writer is international affairs editor\n"FT" and "Financial Times" are trademarks of the Financial Times.

('Maybe. And, of course, worth the effort. Without an effort, the two state solution is dead; if failed, on the other hand, also\ndead. Another idea, don\'t know if it can be made to work: How to introduce Israel entering the NPT and ending its nuclear\nambiguity, which is its state policy, but which itself is the model for Iran now. Can this issue be used profitably in\nnegotiations, a wild card, as it were? Can options be developed on whether it can, how it might work, potential effect on\npeace process? Israel\'s nuclear ambiguity policy is certainly a big issue coming given Iran.

He is the author of "Israel and the Bomb" and the forthcoming "The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel\'s\nBargain with the Bomb."\nAvner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now,\nand why would that be good for Israel?\n"Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a\ncomprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just\nanachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an \'own goal\' for Israel. In my view, it\nundermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the\nresponsible states in this strategic field."\nAre you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually\nmarginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. •\n"Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state\'\nsurrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel\'s image was different then.\n"In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it\nwill be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the\nnuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you don\'t have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be."\nThe United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu\'s visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the\nthreats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures.\nThe Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look\nas though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I don\'t\nbelieve this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis."\nDo you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands\nthat Israel disarm?\n"Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody \'demands that Israel make such an announcement without\nfirst doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel\nhas its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things."\nWhat about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race\nagainst Israel?\n"I don\'t dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be\nprepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though\nthey were children: If they are told that Israel doesn\'t admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I\nbelieve the Arab countries don\'t want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and\nrealistically."\nYou say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israel\'s nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel\nsupporters.\n"But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can\neven remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle.\n"If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international\ncommunity thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear\nweapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less\npatience the world will have for Israel."\nHow do you envision the scenario of \'coming out of the nuclear closet?\'\n"Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is\nvery hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didn\'t exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more\nopenly.\n"Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there\nis no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation.\n"On the international level, it\'s a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by\nIsrael\'s government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk\nabout the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these\nweapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I don\'t think Israel would need to go into detail\nregarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has.\n"Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are\nsinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can\'t tell the awful truth - and I don\'t think it is so awful. This\nis a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something\npositive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic...\n"All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.\nWhether that will happen in our lifetimes I can\'t say."\nYou say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the\nquestion of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion?\n"There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an\nunacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguity\'s power derives from the fact that Israeli society\naccepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security.\n"Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be\nhandled by \'trustworthy hands\' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself.\nAmbiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on\nthis subject."\nWhat\'s it like researching a topic nobody discusses?\n"When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be\ntouched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researcher\'s perspective, not from\nthe standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter.\nToday I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues."\n• Print Page\n• Send to a friend.\n• Comments\n• Share\n• Text Size -1-1:\n• Follow us on Twitter\n• Become a Haaretz.com Faceboolr friend\nThis story is by:\n• atasha Mozoovaya',)
('FYI\nThe Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com\nWar on terror: Obama softened the language, but\nhardened Muslim hearts\nThe Obama administration\'s shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans\' fear of\nIslam. But the new rhetoric hasn\'t matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high.\nBy Stuart Gottlieb\nposted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT\nNew Haven, Conn. —\nOne of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration\'s counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America\'s rhetorical approach\nto the threat of terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. "The language we use matters," President Obama told the Arabic satellite television station\nAl Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like "war on terrorism," "radical Islam," and\n"jihadist."The White House\'s 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term "Islamic terrorism" with "violent extremism."\nThe purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold.\nFirst, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism, which Mr. Obama believes\ncontributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was "at war with Islam." Indeed, the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama\'s outreach to\nthe Muslim world to build "a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest."\nSecond, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans\' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands of\nextremists.\nLanguage change ineffective\nNow it is fair to ask whether Obama\'s use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn\'t. The first, by the\nBrookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in\nObama\'s approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as "discouraged" by the Obama\npresidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent.\nThe second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five years\nearlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions\n(in 2002, it was 25 percent).\nThese starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity – an\nongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital\n– the counterproductive "smoke \'em out" rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point.\nBut if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility – and thus effectiveness – of the overall\ncounterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole.\nRhetoric doesn\'t match policy\nWhen looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up the\nwar in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1,000 Muslim detainees in Guantanamo,\nBagram, and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel.\nThis is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddled\nObama\'s oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements.\nThe price of downplaying the threat\nA large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bush\'s hard-line tactics — the USA Patriot\nAct, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in\nterrorism activity.\nFor example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described the suspect as an "isolated extremist," despite his ties to Al\nQaeda. And the administration\'s initial response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to\ncall it a "one-off\' event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plots\nwere unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam.\nThere is little doubt that the administration\'s unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the public\'s trust. A Gallup\npoll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49\npercent to 42 percent last fall.\nTime to reverse the trend\nObama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His instincts to maintain aggressive\ntactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that\noverstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that understates the threat, especially when detached from policy.\nIt is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric — which has not paid\ndividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.\nStuart Gottlieb, a former foreign-policy adviser and speechwriter in the US Senate (1999-2003), is now director of policy studies at the Jackson Insti\ntute for Global Affairs at Yale.

('For your Sunday reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher.\n"Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach"By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin,\nAugust 2010)\nMarwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional\nsettlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first\non securing end-game "deposits" from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might\nnot be willing to give at the onset, but that can be "deposited" with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is\nwilling to do the same. Saudi Arabia\'s deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details\nabout Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises\nthe Palestinians would need to accept.\nMuasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for\nfull Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to\naddress the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all\nlogistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for\ndelivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel\'s deposit would spell out its\ncommitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan.\nAccording to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending\nthe conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to\nMuasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the\nU.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the\ntable in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence-\nbuilding measures to move all sides toward the end game.\nAM',)

Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. Lewis\nFaltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: taking\na firm stand on how to end the conflict.\nAn American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and thereby\nchange the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America\'s strongest assets is the\nability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define the\nzone of negotiability.\nThis does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guide\nthe parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for "two states," but must now say more\nabout what that means in practice.\nEven if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offs\nnecessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on "borders and security," as many have proposed, is itself unlikely\nwithout Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for later\ndiscussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongest\nwhen all the core issues are addressed.\nAn American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a public\nframework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert the\nimportance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts and\nmeetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement on\nthe peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program.\nA clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelenting\nonslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchor\npresent-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future.\nPerhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question.\nAt a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support a\ncompromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations and\nguarantees; reiterate America\'s support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standing\ncommitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimate\ninterest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula.\nWhat would it take for American ideas to succeed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to \'pre-cook\'\nthis declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principles\nwould be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support.\nThus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purpose\nwould be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim at\ninfluencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need our\nsupport.\nTiming and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some time\nmust elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can be\nredirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate.\nA presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. It\nshould be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and our\nQuartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort. To maximize support from key\nmembers of Congress, the speech should occur before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalemated\nparties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum if\nour purpose is not to be undermined.\nThe speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; for\nexample, progress in the Annapolis process.\nAs for the substance, in its endorsement of a two-state solution and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, the Obama\nAdministration has hinted that a Palestinian settlement should also accompany normalized relations between Israel and\nthe Arab states, putting a broader framing around what has traditionally been defined as a conflict between Israel and\nits immediate neighbors. The normalization piece of the puzzle should be more fully articulated as part of a new strategy\nbased on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a long\noverdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative.\nIf the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is defined\nby as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of what\nthey will never gain without one.\nSkeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under current\nleaders, exposing them to withering domestic criticism. Others argue that it will galvanize obstructionists, not those who\nsupport compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost to\nAmerican prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapse\nof the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forces\nthat seek to undermine, rather than promote peace.\nAmerica can and must do more than limit itself to managing a conflict that has all too often upended our shared\ninterests in peace and stability.\nEND\nChester A.

They include papers on security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes in\nIsrael and the territories, etc.\nI will deliver a set of those papers to your office on Monday\nIf it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in the\ngroup, or give you some names.\nA few observations following up our call this am.:\n(1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don\'t think impossible. If Bibi can say he has secured\nunprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide to\nplay the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israeli\nrelations. His opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be "in the room".\n(2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. not\nan early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel each\nother out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S.\n(3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you or\nMitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has been\nagreed, and to move things along. .\n(4) On the critical issue of security, I don\'t think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expect\nan IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitional\nphase. Question is how long.\n(5) As you know, Abbas\' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, I\nthink he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to be\nunreasonable. And in that event, I expect he will resign. His minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967.\nThis is all tricky business, but I don\'t think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form of\nstatesmanship for you to try.\nI am leaving on Monday for some foreign travel but can be reached through my office -- Laura\nHuber\nSandy',)

('PVerveer\nSaturday, December 18, 2010 1:22 PM\nchild marriage defeat\nThe defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what\'s to come. After passing the Senate unanimously, there\nwas every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly\ndistressing. We have our work more than cut out for us.\nOn another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the\nwhole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray.

(R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that\nwould have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about\nthe legislation\'s cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that\nthe °barna administration will face in advancing its women\'s rights and foreign aid agenda during the next\nCongressional session.\nNon-governmental organizations, women\'s rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years\ndeveloping and lobbying for the "International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010," which\nthe House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166\nvoted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under "suspension of the rules." This\nprocedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of\nrequiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage.\n; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill.\nfailed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including\nAppropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member\nRoger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS).\nif passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance "to prevent the incidence of child\nmarriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal\nempowerment of girls and women." It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year\nstrategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual\nevaluation of countries\' human rights practices.\nSo what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6"\nshe objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not\nproviding an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The \'\nsaid the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to\n2015.\nRos-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet\ngDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinen\'s bill removed the implementation\nprocedures that gave the legislation teeth. "Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual\nimplementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,"\nthey wrote.\nRegardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out\nagainst it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill\nfrom GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote "no" on the bill and encouraging all\nRepublicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters.\n"There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to\ncombat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws," the alert read.\nThe bill doesn\'t contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already\n; prohibited by what\'s known as the almenè" which has been boiler plate language in appropriations\nbills since 1973.\nInvoking the abortion issue sent the bill\'s supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt,\nconsidering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have\nan impact on the abortion issue.\nRep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat\nthe forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning.\n"Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum\n(D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are\ncoercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so they\'re not forced into marriage\nat the age of 12 and 13," LaTourette said. "Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didn\'t work people\nhad to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. I\'m a Republican. I\'m glad we beat their butt in the\nelection, but there comes a time when, enough is enough."\nBut it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch,\n(R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will\ncontrol the Foreign Affairs committee.\nThe main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed\nin the House.\n-The action on the House floor stopping the Child \'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women.\nand girls around the world," Durbin said in a Thursday statement. "These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be\nbrutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue\nthis barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill."\nFor the NGO and women\'s advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this\nbill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against\nWomen Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the "Mexico City Policy," which would\nprevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion.\n"Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, we\'re going to see a debate\nlike the one we just saw," said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. "It\'s hard to imagine how any\ndevelopment bills are going to pass in this environment."\nThe protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate\nthe issue Thursday when rolling out the State Department\'s Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She\nhas said that forced child marriage is "a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights", and that "the\nDepartment of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse".\nState\'s Ambassador at Large for Global Women\'s Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind\nthe scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bill\'s supporters said that the administration was\nnowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers\nPrevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports.\nUnited Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the\nages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council,\nreproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current\ntrends continue.\n!\nOne of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is\nthe Pakistani militasy\'s failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistan\'s tribal areas as a safe\n- haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan.\nPakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South\nWaziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border\nareas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent\ngroups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside.\nPakistan\'s envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will\nengage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is\nsufficient support in all areas of Pakistan\'s government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the\nmission can be completed effectively.\n"Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a\nmodern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country," Haqqani said in an exclusive\ninterview with The Cable. "But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success."\nHaqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in\nwhich domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a\nposition to expand its war on the extremists now.\n"Right now, it\'s only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in\ndealing with flood relief work," he said. "We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country,\nand those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period."\nHe also noted that "there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,"\nand that Pakistan\'s government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a\ntimeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones.\n"Sometimes it\'s easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes\ndecisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities," Haqqani said.\nIn several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on\nattacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being\nunrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan-\nPakistan border, which have existed for decades.\n, "There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done\ntheir way," another Pakistani government official said.\n; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of\nthe blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the \'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.\n\'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such\nas speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing\nPakistan the means for large scale operations," the official said.\nThe United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its\nwar against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize\nas the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistan\'s severe problems.\n"It\'s very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan," one Pakistani official said.\nIn remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when\ndiscussing his administration\'s ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan.\n"Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all\nour countries, especially Pakistan. We\'ve welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will\ncontinue to help strengthen Pakistanis\' capacity to root out terrorists," said Obama. "Nevertheless, progress has not\ncome fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders\nmust be dealt with."\nUndersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there\nwas more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and\nNATO-led mission in Afghanistan.\n"Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment," she said. "Their\ncalculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic\npartnership."\nThe White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far.

('sbwhoeop\nSaturday, October 9, 2010 10:50 AM\nH: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in this\nblitzkrieg. Sid\nWhy is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as\na Nazi?\nBy Joshua Green\nAn election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the\nRepublican nominee for Congress from Ohio\'s 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German\nWaffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments.\nRich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform.\nlott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted\nto re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the\nEastern Front during World War 11. lott\'s participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign\'s website, and\nhis name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his\ninvolvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not\nsubscribe to the tenets of Nazism. "No, absolutely not," he said. "In fact, there\'s a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And\nyou\'ll find that on almost any reenactment website. it\'s purely historical interest in World War II."\nRich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website.\nlott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, "I\'ve always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively\nsmall country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of\nEurope and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military\npoint of view, that\'s incredible."\nlott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian\nArmy, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The group\'s website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment\nvideo, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939.\nThe website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to\nthe "twisted" nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism:\nNazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to\nensure a "New and Free Europe", free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by -\nmany in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the\nprotector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite\ntwisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men\ndied defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no\nmatter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the\nforeign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free.\nHistorians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. "These guys don\'t know their history," said Charles\nW. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of "Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death\'s Head Division, 1933-45,"\nwhich chronicles an SS division. "They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred." Sydnor added that re-\nenactments like the Wiking group\'s are illegal in Germany and Austria. "If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany\ntoday, you\'d be arrested."\nSee web-only content:\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/\nChristopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, "It is so unhistorical and\nso apologetic that you don\'t know to what degree they\'ve simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who\nlove putting on uniforms."\nloft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as\n2003), but did so with his son "as a father-son bonding thing." He says his name and pictures were removed from the\nWiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years\nago, after his son lost interest.\nloft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias "Reinhard Pferdmann," which has also been\nremoved, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. "Part of the reenactor\'s [experience]," lott said, "is the\nliving-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units\nwhat individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based\naround your own real experiences. \'Reinhard\' of course is \'Richard\' in German. And \'Pferdmann,"pferd\' is a horse. So it\'s\nliterally \'horse man."\nAsked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactor\'s group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he\nhoped it would not: "They have to take it in context. There\'s reenactors out there who do everything. You couldn\'t do Civil\nWar re-enacting if somebody didn\'t play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something that\'s definitely way in the past.\n... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And that\'s strictly all."\n0\nlott at Nazi re-enactment.\nRabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B\'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district,\ndisagreed. "Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and\ncertainly in poor taste, if not offensive," he said. "I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the\nJewish community, but the broader community."\nIn a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups\nbut made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: "Never, in any of my reenacting of\nmilitary history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the\ntragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the\nmilitary and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life." He added that\nhe has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II\nAmerican infantryman and paratrooper.\nThe actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book "The Death Marches of\nHungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945," Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers\nfrom the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to\nAmerican forces in Austria.\n"What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but that\'s kind of a dodge," says\nProf. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. "The\nentire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of \'subhumans,\' Slays were going to be enslaved\nin numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be\nexterminated altogether. That\'s what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that\npeople want to dress up and play SS on the weekend."\nThis article available online at:\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/\nCopyright © 2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

His website is\nhere\nSubjects:\n• Democracy and government\n• International politics\n• United States\n• democracy & power\n• american power & the world\n• rise of the new right\nThe rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama \'5 presidency is\nshaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But\nwhere has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal\nbegin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of "Republican Gomorrah", enters the heady\nworld of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence\nthat fuel its sub-culture\'s insurgent activism.\n"He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since\nthe Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?\nIn reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-\nSemite and Jew\nI am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack\nObama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.\nPerusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard\nurgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. "These people that\nare purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what\'s going on in this country", a gun dealer told me outside\na show in Reno. "Good luck Obama", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. "We outnumber him 100 to 1." At this time,\nthe Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media\'s radar.\nIn September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan\nWalton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay\nformer Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen\ncollege Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a "left-wing hack" while a hysterical\nyoung man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a "racist". Afterward,\nuniversity police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he\nshouted threats.\nWho was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative\nof a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of\nRepublican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in\nhomosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a\ncurable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of\nrun-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.\nMy encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be\nsymptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right\'s days of\nrage were only beginning.\nThe constellation\nThrough his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against\npartisanship, declaring that there were "no red states" and no "conservative America". Apparently, he thought it was\nmerely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and\nwomen\'s rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to\nthink that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was\nnot deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain "divisive" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures\ntoward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but\nseparated by "partisans". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.\nMany of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his\ninnocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could "bridge the partisan divide". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected\nconservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies "fifth columnists" but now fervently supported Obama,\nwrote that the new president was destined to become "a liberal Reagan who can reunite America". This optimism\npervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.\nAfter all, why couldn\'t we all just get along?\nIn his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: "I serve\nas a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views." Once he was elected,\nconservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama\'s strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most\nfearsome images they could conjure (see "Barack Obama, the fallen messiah", 23 December 2009).\nObama\'s multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected\nObama\'s legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the "Birther" movement that sought\nto challenge his citizenship. The movement\'s most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a\ndentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling\nin the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that\nObama planned to create a "civilian national security force", Taitz told me she "realised that Obama was another Stalin -\nit\'s a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler\'s Germany."\nAfter becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama\'s family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,\nTaitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California\'s secretary of state Debra Bowen\ndemanding an investigation into Obama\'s eligibility to serve as president. Taitz\'s plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an\nOrange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly\nprayed for Obama\'s death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,\nTaitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers\nfrom Sean Hannity to CNN\'s Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her "greatest supporter", was eventually fired as\nan indirect result of his hosting of her).\nIn March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential\ncandidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice\nin government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican\nrespondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn\'t born in the United States, while 30% "weren\'t\nsure". "Obama should be in the Big House", Taitz shrieked to me, "not the White House!"\nWhen Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement\nactivated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the "Other", making him\nseem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a\nhealthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama\'s dream of\nbipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss\'s MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-\nright activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on\nWashington\'s National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News\'s\ntop-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the "9-12 Project" to restore the sense of unity (and siege\nmentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.\nWhile covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America\'s security than al-Qaida;\ndemonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama\'s face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;\nothers carried signs questioning Obama\'s status as a United States citizen. "We can fight al-Qaida, we can\'t kill Obama",\nsaid an aging demonstrator. Another told me, "Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world", pointing to placards he had\nfashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives\' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to\nanother activist, Obama\'s agenda was similar to Hitler\'s: "Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had\nhis own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that."\nThe seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies\nagainst Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as\nthe French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot\nassassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.\nMembers of the Tea Party "Patriots" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to\nHitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government\nof the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped\nObama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no\ninterest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea\nParty\'s primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president\nand his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always\ntransparent.\nThe Tea Party\'s strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats\nbut also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced\nthis would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the\n"real America". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting\nthat 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying "ABCNews.com reported an approximate\nfigure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters." Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of "Freedom works! Freedom\nworks!" Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-\ngroup, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson\'s version of William Wallace in Bra veheart.\nIndeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea\nParty movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.\nThe movement\'s leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea\nParty "Patriots" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey\'s\nlobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant\nBristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey\'s other "real American"\nclients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People\'s Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from\nSaddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected\na consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks\npaid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.\nThe rumour\nIf Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after\nObama\'s inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin\'s motives for quitting\nbecame clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular\ncontributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, "Sarah Palin\'s Alaska".\nPalin\'s book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential\ncampaign and a travelling carnival.\nWhether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the\nRepublican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos\ndesperately seeking to expand the party\'s base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain\'s\ncampaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin\'s nomination in 2012 would be\n"catastrophic" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one\nof the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for\nSchmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its\nmost fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.\nA special congressional election in New York\'s heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test\nof Palin\'s power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown\nfar-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate\nRepublican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin\'s ideological purge in upstate New York led to an\nimprobable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies\nclaimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She\nwent on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky\'s\nGOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush\'s vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand\'s\nregular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.\nThe self-described "hardcore pro-lifer" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay\nmarriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement\'s ranks, recasting herself\naccordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of "economic freedom". She claimed the Democratic "cap-\nand-trade" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare\nreform as a Trojan horse for "socialism" (though she admitted her family "used to hustle over the border" to take\nadvantage of Canada\'s single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted\nout on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for "death panels" that would\nrecommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin\ntransformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.\nThe source of Palin\'s "death panels" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York\'s lieutenant governor Betsy\nMcCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed\nin an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into\nthe government\'s programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine\nAward, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic\'s editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a\nrumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as "the lie of 2009". McCaughey\'s\nlatest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the\nmainstream.\nIn June 2009, one of LaRouche\'s top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health\'s\nchief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler\'s\nT-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. "President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus\nreviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin\ncharged. Soon, LaRouche\'s followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a\nHitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a\nLaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: "Why do you continue to support a Nazi\npolicy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?"\nTwo months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker\nNewt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of\nindignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death\npanels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of "the devaluing of human life, putting a price on\neach individual." He thundered, "The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!"\nThe death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican\nParty. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the\nfederal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-\nsponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,\nwhen the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the\ngovernment to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.\nThe enemy\nThe slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.\nThe new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney\'s daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep\nAmerica Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN\'s Larry King about the Birther movement\nthat was challenging Obama\'s status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: "One of the reasons you see people\nso concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so\nreluctant to defend the nation overseas." With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same\ntable, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.\nThe experiments in "terror-management theory" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of\nSkidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have\ndemonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain\nthe effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American\nand somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical\nreasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters\nresponded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing\narmy ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.\nObama\'s first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed\nby far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat\nteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski\'s best friend told reporters the young killer "grew angry recently over\nfears Obama would outlaw guns." Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website\nportraying Fox\'s Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough\ninvestigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party\nrallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation\nRescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by\nthe anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas\'s only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight\nepisodes of Bill O\'Reilly\'s "O\'Reilly Factor," O\'Reilly had referred to Tiller as "Tiller the baby killer", a criminal guilty of\n"Nazi stuff." "I wouldn\'t want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day", O\'Reilly proclaimed.\nIn August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and\ngunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini\'s motives away by homing in on passages in his\nonline diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic\nmasturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual\nfrustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.\nThe day after Obama\'s election victory, Sodini wrote: "Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media\nLOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama\'s plans for the\neconomy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude\nthing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. \'Not my little girl\', daddy\nsays! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original]."\nIn another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans\' Whitewater investigation, Sodini\nrevealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, "Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton," from a National Review ad.\nA year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: "I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring\nthe country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don\'t think any group of political leaders will\nachieve this for us." Whether or not Sodini\'s murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically\ndeath-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: "Death\nlives!"\nThe bible\nMore than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and\nconspiracy that consumed the Tea Party "Patriots". During a broadcast of "Fox and Friends", Beck opined that Obama\n"has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white\nculture." As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community\norganiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck\'s crusade. From there, Beck targeted another\nblack Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of\nObama\'s "socialist" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to\n"Obama money" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-\nbased youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to\nBeck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that "Obama\'s SS" was being\ntrained across inner-city America.\nIn September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to\nuse the poor people\'s advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. "Trust me", Beck said,\n"Everybody now says they\'re going to be talking about healthcare. I don\'t think so." (His statement was reminiscent of\nRush Limbaugh\'s scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: "Whitewater is about healthcare.")\nBeck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O\'Keefe and Hannah\nGiles inside Acorn field offices.\nIn the videos, O\'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she\nwas a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O\'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp\ncostume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later\nadmitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of\nall criminal wrongdoing.\nIn a separate incident O\'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals\ndisguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary\nLandrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O\'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded\nconservative outfits; O\'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured\nleading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.\nWhile O\'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned\nthe highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O\'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck\'s\nopinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. "Glenn Beck has taught us everything we\nknow", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. "He\'s opened our eyes to so much."\nBut unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich\'s Republican counter-revolution of 1994,\nBeck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,\nBeck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in\nhopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine\nand alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. "We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the\ndrugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who\ncalled himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.\nLike Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan\'s 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-\ndestructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away\nin a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from\nfreedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into\nconservative radio diatribes.\n,When Beck first broke into television on CNN\'s Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political\nworldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and\noften snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,\nMatthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting\nthe work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.\nSuddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.\nThanks to Beck\'s designation of Skousen\'s pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as "required reading" on the\nwebsite of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the\nHidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen\'s Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon\nand a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to\nselling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is\nlittle more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,\nto explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation\nis un-American, that "coercive taxation" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin\nFranklin, who wrote at length on the merits of "amours" with "old women," and who famously solicited prostitutes and\nfathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.\nThough Skousen claims the Founders as the world\'s foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with\nfringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd\'s screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that\n"powerful influences congregating in the United States" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United\nStates into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd\'s manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen\'s Digest, which he\nfounded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.\nSkousen\'s paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He\nboasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist\nplots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen\'s son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours\nof Hoover\'s cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)\nSkousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City\'s police chief for, in the words of the city\'s conservative Mormon mayor,\n"conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government."\nFrom there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and\nearning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of "promoting [his] own anti-\ncommunism for obvious financial purposes."\nSkousen\'s vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society\'s claim that communists controlled President Dwight\nEisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the\nradar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling\neveryone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints\ndistanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared\nentirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik\nobserved in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen\'s renewed influence through Beck and the Tea\nParty "suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place."\nThe descent\nBesides influencing Beck, Skousen\'s teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement\'s most visible grassroots\ncelebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.\nOn a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his\nmentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his\nspellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. "If you control the food supply", Mack warned, "you control the\npeople. And that\'s the first step to slavery."\nAlready a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun\nViolence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack\nreemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.\nAlong with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea\nParty militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to\nrefuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.\nBecause the group\'s members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.\nBesides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established\nfigure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and\nTactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on "war criminals, secret policemen, rats." With Obama in office,\nVandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by\ncashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.\nFor all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama\'s agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the\ngreatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since\n1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform\nwas introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the\nde facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure\nthat the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.\nBut after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He\nintroduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance\nplans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in\nhealthcare negotiations. "He\'s a big hero now in the pro-life community", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to\nGeorge W Bush - told me in November 2009. "Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats\nhaving any power."\nTo the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to\nHudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision\nforbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,\nObama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he\nand his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports\nseeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out\nvirulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of\ndiatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: "Bart the Baby-Killer."\nOn 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol\'s Longworth Building in expectation of\nObama\'s pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the\ncivil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the\ncrowd on their way inside the Capitol. "Nigger!" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a "faggot", eliciting\nlaughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel\nCleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.\nWith the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of "Kill the bill!" drifted into calls for violence. "I would gladly stand\nwith any of you men here and take these fascists down", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of\nan amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. "You haven\'t heard the last of me!"\nThe next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The\ndemonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House\nfloor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.\nRepublican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak\'s original amendment, demanded\na motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In\nresponse, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. "The motion to commit does\nnot support life", Stupak declared. "It is the Democrats who have stood up...." Heckling from the Republican side\ninterrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing\nRepublican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, "Baby\nkiller!" Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults.\nWhile the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a\nright-wing Kristallnacht. "If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows",\nVanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. "Break them NOW. Break them and\nrun to break again." Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and\nArizona had been shattered.\nMeanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed\nto the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative\nAnthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.\nThe brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged\nafter a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman\'s) and encouraged\nactivists to "drop by" to express their anger about Perriello\'s recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic\nRepresentative Gabrielle Giffords\' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the\nwindow of Representative Louise Slaughter\'s office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper\nattacks.\nAfter the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.\nCrusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows\nof elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence\nthickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: "Don\'t Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!" Thus concluded the\nfirst phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.',)

Such a mood now seems to be\nspreading through the United States. It\'s\nnot so surprising, really: Since the attacks\nof September 11, 2001, fear has\nbeen iniiecttcl into this "homeland" like a\ndrug and a penumbia of official secrecy has\nsettled over the land in a way that makes\nthe secrecy of the Cold War years (when\nthis country faced a superpower, not a\nragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and\nterrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.\nIn an atmosphere of swirling fears and\nhysteria amid declining living conditions,\n"explanations" that at other times might\nhave remained confined to tiny crews of\nconspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a\npatina of plausibility and so traction. No\nwonder then that, as hard times hit, as the\nfinancial system seemed on the verge of\ncollapse, as unemployment soared and a\nmassive wave of home foreclosures swept\ninto view, increasing numbers of\nAmericans became prey to any wacky\nexplanation for our troubles, none more so\nthan the idea that Islam was somehow\nresponsible, that mosques and Islamic\ncenters meant for a sliver of a minority here\nwere capable of imposing anything, no less\na way of life on this country, or that Sharia\nlaw (of all things) might somehow worm\nits way into state teal systems, or that\nYouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthy\nof suppression, or... well, you name it.\nMax Blumenthal, author of the bestselling\nbook Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside the\nMovement Thai Shattered the Party, has\ndone the necessary legwork to"take us deep\ninto one of those crews of conspiracy-\nmongers who, at another time, just about\nno one would have paid much attention to,\nbut in twenty-first-century America have\ngained a remarkable audience. They are a\nchilling barometer of the changing weather\nin America. Torn\nThe Great\nIslamophobic\nCrusade\nInside the Bizarre\nCabal of Secretive\nDonors, Demagogic\nBloggers, Pseudo-\nScholars, European\nNeo-Fascists, Violent\nIsraeli Settlers, and\nRepublican Presidential\nHopefuls Behind the\nCrusade\nBy Max Blumenthal\nNine years after 9/11,\nhysteria about Muslims in\nAmerican life has gripped\nthe country. With it has\nGone an outburst of arson\nattacks on mosques,\ncampaigns to stop their\nconstruction, and the\nbranding of the Muslim-\nAmerican community,\noverwhelmingly moderate,\nas a hotbed of potential\nterrorist recruits. The frenzy\nhas raged from rural\nTennessee to New York\nCity, while in Oklahoma,\nvoters even overwhelmingly\nApproved a ballot measure\nbanning the implementation\nof Sharia law in American\ncourts (not that such a\nprospect existed). This\ncampaign of islamophobia\nwounded President Oba.ma\npolitically, as one out of five\nAmericans have bought\ninto a sustained chorus of\nfalse rumors about his secret\nMuslim faith. And it may\nhave tainted views of\nMuslims in general; an\nAugust 2010 Pew Research\nCenter poll revealed that,\namong Americans, the\nfavorability rating of\nMuslims had dropped by 11\npoints since 2005.\nErupting so many years after\nthe September 11th trauma,\nthis spasm of anti-Muslim\nbigotry might seem oddly\ntimed and unexpectedly\nspontaneous. But think\nagain: it\'s the fruit of an\norganized, long-term\ncampaign by a tight\nconfederation of right-Wing\nactivists and operatives who\nfirst focused on\nIsia.mophobia soon after the\nSeptember 11th attacks, but\nonly attained critical mass\nduring the Obama era. It\nwas then that embittered\nconservative forces, voted\nout of power in 2008, sought\nwith remarkable success to\nleverage cultural resentment\ninto political and partisan\ngain.\nThis network is obsessively\nfixated on the supposed\nspread of Muslim influence\nin America. Its apparatus\nspans continents, extending\nfrom Tea Party activists here\nto the European far right. It\nbrings together in common\ncause right-wing ultra-\nZionists, Christian\nevangelicals, and racist\nBritish soccer hooligans. It\nreflects an aggressively pro-\nIsrael sensibility, with its\nkey figures venerating the\nJewish state as a Middle\nEastern Fort Apache on the\nfront lines of the Global\nWar on Terror and urging\nthe U.S. and various\nEuropean powers to emulate\nits heavy-handed methods.\nLittle of recent American\nJslamophobia (with a.strong\nemphasis on the "phobia") is\nsheer happenstance. Years\nbefore Tea Party shock\ntroops massed for angry\nprotests outside the\nproposed site of an Islamic\ncommunity center in lower\nManhattan, representatives\nof the Israel lobby and the\nJewish-American\nestablishment launched a\ncampaign against pro-\nPalestinian campus activism\nthat would prove a seedbed\nfor everything to come. That\ncampaign quickly -- and\nperhaps predictably --\nmorphed into a series of\ncrusades against mosques\nand islarilic schools which,\nin turn, attracted an\nassortment of shady but\nexceptionally energetic\nmilitants into the network\'s\nranks.\nBesides providing the initial\nenergy for the islamophobic\ncrusade, conservative\nelements from within the\npro-Israel lobby bankrolled\nthe network\'s apparatus,\nenabling it to influence the\nnational debate. One\nphilanthropist in particular\nhas provided the\nbeneficence to propel the\ncampaign ahead. He is a\nlittle-known Los Angeles-\narea software security\nentrepreneur named Aubrey\nChernick, who operates out\nof a security consulting firm\nblandly named the National\nCenter for Crisis and\nContinuity Coordination. A\nformer trustee of the\nWashington Institute for\nNear East Policy, which has\nserved as a think tank for the\nAmerican Israeli Public\nAffairs Committee\n(AIPAC), a frontline\nlobbying group for Israel,\nChernick is said to be worth\n$750 million.\nChemick\'s fortune is puny\ncompared to that of the\nbillionaire Koch Brothers,\nextraction industry titans\nwho fund Tea Party-related\ngroups like Americans for\nProsperity, and it is dwarfed\nby the financial empire of\nHaim Saban, the Israeli-\nAmerican media baron who\nis one of the largest.-orivate\ndonors to the Democratic\nparty and recently matched\n$9 million raised for the\nFriends of the Israeli\nDefense Forces in a single\nnight. However, by injecting\nhis money into a small but\ninfluential constellation of\ngroups and individuals with\na narrow agenda. Chernick\nhas had a considerable\nimpact.\nThrough the Fairtmook\nFoundation, a private entity\nhe and his wife Joyce\ncontrol, Chernick has\nprovided funding to groups\nranging from the Anti-\nDefamation League (ADL)\nand CAMERA, a right-\nwing, pro-Israel, media-\nwatchdog outfit, to violent\nIsraeli settlers living on\nPalestinian lands and figures\nlike the pseudo-academic\nauthor Robert Spencer, who\nis largely responsible for\npopularizing conspiracy\ntheories about the coming\nconquest of the West by\nMuslim fanatics seeking to\nestablish a worldwide\ncaliphate. Together, these\ngroups spread hysteria about\nMuslims into Middle\nAmerican communities\nwhere immigrants from the\nMiddle East have recently\nsettled, and they watched\nwith glee as likely\nRepublican presidential\nfrontrunners from Mike\nHuckabee to Sarah Palin\npmmoted their cause and\noarpe.ki their tropes.\nPerhaps the only thing more\nsurprising than the\nincreasingly widespread\nappeal of islamophobia is\nthat, just a few years ago,\nthe phenomenon was\nconfined to a few college\ncampuses and an inner city\nneighborhood, and that it\nseemed like a fleeting fad\nthat would soon pass from\nthe American political\nlandscape.\nBirth of a Network\nThe fslamophobic crusade\nwas launched in earnest at\nthe peak of George W.\nBush\'s prestige when the\nneoconservatives and their\nallies were riding high. In\n2003, three years after the\ncollapse of President Bill\nClinton\'s attempt to resolve\nthe Israeli-Palestinian issue\nand in the immediate wake\nof the invasion of Iraq, a\nnetwork of Jewish groups,\nranging from ADL and the.\nAmerican Jewish\nCommittee to AIPAC,\ngathered to address what\nthey saw as a sudden rise in\npro-Palestinian activism on\ncollege campuses\nnationwide. That meeting\ngave birth to the David\nProject, a campus advocacy\ngroup led by Charles Peters,\nwho had co-founded\nCAMERA, one of the many\noutfits bankrolled by\nChernick. With the help of\npublic relations\nprofessionals,.

The film\nportrayed that New York\nCity school\'s Department of\nMiddle East and Asian\nLanguages and Cultures as a\nhothouse of anti-Semitism.\nIn their complaints, the\nstudents focused on one\nfigure in particular: Joseph\n.vlassa.d, a Palestinian\nprofessor of Middle East\nstudies. He was known for\nhis passionate advocacy of\nthe formation of a binational\nstate between Israel and\nPalestine, as well as for his\nstrident criticism of what he\ntermed "the racist character\nof Israel." The film\nidentified him as "one of the\nmost dangerous intellectuals\non campus," while he was\nfeatured as a crucial villain\nin The Professors: The 101\nMost Dangerous Academics\nin America, a book by the\n(Chemick-•funded)\nneoconservative activist\nDavid Horowitz. As\nMassad was seeking tenure\nat the time, he was\nespecially vulnerable to this\nsort of wholesale assault.\nWhen the controversy over\nMassad\'s views intensified,\nCongressman Anthony\nWeiner, a liberal New York\nDemocrat who pqee\n:lescri himself as a\nrepresentative of "the ZOA\n[Zionist Organization of\nAmerica] wing of the\nDemocratic Party,"\ndemanded that Columbia\nPresident Lee Bollinger,\na\nrenowned First Amendment\nscholar, fire the professor.\nBollinger responded by\nissuing uncharacteristically\ndefensive statements about\nthe "limited" nature of\nacademic freedom.\nIn the end, however, none of\nthe charges stuck. Indeed,\nthe testimonies in the David\nProject film were eventually\neither discredited or never\ncorroborated. In 2009,\nMassad earned tenure after\nwinning Columbia\'s\nprestigious Lionel Trilling\nAward for excellence in\nscholarship.\nHaving demonstrated its\nability to intimidate faculty\nmembers and even powerful\nuniversity administrators,\nhowever, Kramer claimed a\nmoral victory in the name of\nhis project, boasting to the\npress that "this is a turning\npoint." While the David\nProject subsequently\nfostered chapters on\ncampuses nationwide, its\ndirector set out on a\ndifferent path -- initially,\ninto the streets of Boston in\n2004 to oppose the\nconstruction of the Islamic\nSociety of Boston Cultural\nCenter.\nFor nearly 15 years, the\nIslamic Society of Boston\nhad sought to build the\ncenter in the heart of\nRoxbury, the city\'s largest\nblack neighborhood, to\nserve its sizable Muslim\npopulation. With\nendorsements from Mayor\nThomas Menino and leading\nMassachusetts lawmakers,\nthe mosque\'s construction\nseemed like a fait accompli -\n- until, that is, the Rupert\nMurdoch-owned Boston\nHerald and his local Fox\nNews affiliate snapped into\naction. Boston Globe\ncolumnist Jeff Jacoby also\nchimed in with a series of\nreports claiming the center\'s\nplans were evidence of a\nSaudi Arabian plot to bolster\nthe influence of radical\nIslam in the United States,\nand possibly even to train\nunderground terror cells.\nIt was at this point that the\nDavid Project entered the\nfray, convening elements of\nthe local pro-Israel\ncommunity in the Boston\narea to seek strategies to\ntorpedo the project.\nAccording to emqiis\nobtained by the Islamic\nSociety\'s lawyers in a\nlawsuit against the David\nProject, the organizers\nsettled on a campaign of\nyears of nuisance lawsuits,\nalong with accusations that\nthe center had received\nforeign finding from "the\nWahhabi movement in\nSaudi Arabia or... the\nMoslem Brotherhood."\nIn response, a grassroots\ncoalition of liberal Jews\ninitiat4d inter-faith efforts\naimed at ending a\ncontroversy that had\nessentially been\nmanufactured out of thin air\nand was corroding relations\nbetween the Jewish and\nMuslim communities in the\ncity. Peters would not,\nhowever, relent. \'We are\nmore concerned now than\nwe have ever been about a\nSaudi influence of local\nmosques," he ,apounced at\na suburban Boston\nsynagogue in 2007.\nAfter paying out millions of\ndollars in legal bills and\nenduring countless smears,\nthe Islamic Society of\nBoston completed the\nconstruction of its\ncommunity center in 2008.\nMeanwhile, not surprisingly,\nnothing came of the David\nProject\'s dark warnings. As\nBoston-area National Public\nRadio reporter Philip Martin\nreflected in September 2010,\n"The horror stories that\npreceded [the center\'s]\ndevelopment seem shrill and\nhistrionic in retrospect."\nThe Network Expands\nThis second failed campaign\nwas, in the end, more about\nmovement building than\nsuccess, no less national\nsecurity. The local crusade\nestablished an effective\nblueprint for generating\nhysteria against the\nestablishment of Islamic\ncenters and mosques across\nthe country, while\ngalvanizing a cast of\ncharacters who would form\nan anti-Muslim network\nwhich would gain attention\nand success in the years to\ncome.\nIn 2007, these figures\ncoalesced into a proto-\nmovement that launched a\nnew crusade, this time\ntargeting. the Khalil Gibran\nInternational Academy, a\nsecular Arabic-English\nelementary school in\nBrooklyn, New York.\nCalling their ad hoc pressure\ngroup, Stop the Madrassah\nmadrassah being simply\nthe Arab word for "school" -\n- the coalition\'s activists\nincluded an array of\npreviously unknown zealots\nwho made no attempt to\ndisguise their extreme views\nwhen it came to Islam as a\nreligion, as well as Muslims\nin America. Their stated\ngoal was to challenge the\nschool\'s establishment on\nthe basis of its violation of\nthe church-state separation\nin the U.S.\nConstitution. The true aim\nof the coalition, however,\nwas transparent: to pressure\nthe city\'s leadership to adopt\nan antagonistic posture\ntowards the local Muslim\ncommunity.\nThe activists zeroed in on\nthe school\'s principal,\nDebbie Almontaser, a\nveteran educator of Yemeni\ndescent, and baselessly\n.branded her "a jihadist" as\nwell as a 9/11 denier. They\nalso accused her of-- as\nPamela Geller, a far-right\nblogger just then gaining\nprominence put it,\n"whitewash[ing] the\ngenocide against the\nJews." Daniel Pipes, a\nneoconservative academic\npreviously active in the\ncampaigns against Joseph\nMassad and the Boston\nIslamic center (and whose\npro-Likud think tank,\nMiddle East .Forum, has\nreceived $150,000 from\nChernick) Jamed the\nschool should not go ahead\nbecause "Arabic-language\ninstruction is inevitably\nladen with Pan-Arabist and\nIslamist baggage." As the\ncampaign reached a fever\npitch, Almontaser reported\nthat members of the\ncoalition were actually\nstallsinQ her wherever she\nwent.\nGiven what Columbia\nJournalism School professor\nand former New York Times\nreporter Samuel Freedman\ncalled "her clear, public\nrecord of interfaith activism\nand outreach," including\nwork with the New York\nPolice Department and the\nAnti-Defamation League\nafter the September 11th\nattacks, the assault on\n.Almontaser seemed little\nshort of bizarre -- until her\nassailants discovered a\nphotograph of a T-shirt\nproduced by AWAAM, a\nlocal Arab feminist\norganization, that read\n"Intifada NYC." As it\nturned out, AWAAM\nsometimes shared office\nspace with a Yemeni-\nAmerican association on\nwhich Almontaser served as\na board member. Though\nthe connection seemed like a\nstretch, it promoted the line\nof attack the Stop the\nMadrassah coalition had\nbeen seeking.\nHaving found a way to\nwedge the emotional issue\nof the Israel-Palestine\nconflict into a. previously\nNew York-centered\ncampaign, the school\'s\nopponents next gained a\nplatform at the Murdoch-\nowned New York Post,\nwhere reporters Chuck\nBennett and Jana Winter\nclaimed her T-shirt was\n"apparently a call for a\nGaza-style uprising in the\nBig Apple." While\nAlmontaser attempted to\nexplain to the Post\'s\nreporters that she rejected\nterrorism„ the Anti-\nDefamation League chimed.\nin on cue. ADL spokesman\nOren Segal told the Post:\n"The T-shirt is a reflection\nof a movement that\nincreasingly lauds violence\nagainst Israelis instead of\nrejecting it. That is\ndisturbing."\nBefore any Qassam rockets\ncould be launched from\nAlmontaser\'s school, her\nformer ally New York\nMayor Michael Bloomberg\ncaved to the growing\npressure and threatened to\nshut down the school,\nprompting her to resign. A\nJewish principal who spoke\nno Arabic replaced\nAlmontaser, who later filed\na lawsuit against the city for\nbreaching her free speech\nrights. In 2010, the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity\nCommission ui that New\nYork\'s Department of\nEducation had "succumbed\nto the very bias that the\ncreation of the school was\nintended to dispel" by firing\nAlmontaser and urged it pay\nher $300,000 in damages.\nThe commission also\nconcluded that the Post had\nquoted her misleadingly.\nThough it failed to stop the\nestablishment of the Khalil\nGibran Academy,•the\nburg:eoning anti-M sliin\nmovement succeeded in\nforcing city leaders to bend\nto its will, and having\nlearned just how to do that,\nthen moved on in search of\nmore high-profile targets.\nAs the ,New York Times\ns!..t_..at the time, "The\nfight against the school...\nwas only an early skirmish\nin a broader, national\nstruggle."\ns a battle that has really\njust begun." Pipes told the\nTimes.\nFrom Scam to Publicity\nCoup\nPipes couldn\'t have been\nmore on the mark. In late\n2009, the Isiamophobes\nsprang into action again\nwhen the Cordoba Initiative,\na non-profit Muslim group\nheaded by Feisai Abdul\nRauf, an exceedingly\nmoderate Sufi Muslim imam\nwho regularly\nlepic,,etiting the\nUnited States at the behest\nof the State Department,\nannounced that it was going\nto build a community center\nin downtown New "NCork\nCity. With the help of\ninvestors, Raufs Cordoba\nInitiative purchased space\ntwo blocks from Ground\nZero in Manhattan. The\nspace was to contain a\nprayer area as part of a large\ncommunity center that\nwould be open to everyone\nin the neighborhood.\nNone of these facts mattered\nto Pamela Geller. Thanks to\nconstant prodding at her\nNog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller\nmade Cordoba\'s\nconstruction plans a national\nissue, provokino fervent\ncalls faml conservatives to\nprotect the "hallowed\nground" of 9/11 from\ncreeping Sharia. (That the\n"mosque" would have been\nout of sight of Ground Zero\nand that the neighborhood\nwas, in fact.\neverything from strip clubs\nto fast-food joints didn\'t\nmatter.) Geller\'s activism\nagainst Cordoba House\nearned the 52-year-old full-\ntime blogger the attention\nshe apparently craved.,\nincluding a • 1 in\nthe Neu, York ThIleS and\nfrequent cable news spots,\nesoeciallv, of course, on Fox\nNews.\nMainstream reporters tended\nto focus on Geller\'s bizarre\nstunts. She posted a video\nof herself\nin a string bikini on a Fort\nLauderdale beach, for\ninstance, while ranting about\n"left-tards" and "Nazi\nHezbollah." Her gall for\nboycotting Campbell\'s Soup\nbecause the company\noffered halal -- approved\nunder Islamic law (as kosher\nfood is under Jewish law) --\nversions of its products got\nher much attention, as did\nher .cron-lotior of a screed\nclaiming that President\nBarack Obama was the\nillegitimate lovechild of\nMalcolm X.\nGeller had never earned a\nliving as a journalist. She\nsupported herself with\nmillions of dollars in a\ndivorce settlement and life\ninsurance money from her\nex-husband. He died in\n2008, a year after being\nfor an alleged $1.3\nmillion scam he was\naccused of-running out of a\ncar dealership he co-owned\nwith Geller. Independently\nwealthy and with time on\nher hands, Geller proved\nable indeed when it came to\nexploiting her strange media\nstardom to in.cite the already\norganized political network\nof islamophobes to intensify\ntheir crusade.\nShe also benefited from\nclose alliances with leading\nislamophobes from Europe.\nAmong Ocher\'s allies was\nAndrew Gravers, a Danish\nactivist who formed the\ngroup Stop the\nIslamicization of Europe,\nand :.1a.-ye it the unusually\nblunt motto: "Racism is the\nlowest form of human\nstupidity, but Islamophobia\nis the height of common\nsense." Gravers\' group\ninspired Geller\'s own U.S.-\nbased outfit, Stop the\nIslamicization of America,\nwhich she formed with her\nfriend Robert Spencer, a\npseudo-scholar whose\nbestselling books, including\nThe Truth About\nMuhammad, Founder of the\nWorld\'s Most Intolerant\nReligion, prompted former\nadvisor to President Richard\nNixon and Muslim activist\nRobert Crane to ca/1\n"the principal leader... in\nthe new academic .field of\nMuslim bashing."\n(According to the website\nalmost $1 million\nin donations from Chernick\nhas been steered to\nSpencer\'s Jihad Watch\ngroup through David\nHorowitz\'s Freedom\nCenter.)\nPerfect sources for\nRepublican political figures\nin search of the next hot-\nbutton cause, their rhetoric\nfound its way into the\ntalking points of Newt\nGingrich and Sarah Patin as\nthey propelled the crusade\nagainst Cordoba House into\nthe national spotlight.\nGingrich soon pared the\ncommunity center to a Nazi\nsign next to the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, while\nPatin called it "a stab in the\nheart" of "the Heartland."\nMeanwhile, Tea Party\ncandidates like Republican\nIlario Pantano, an Iraq war\nveteran who killed two\nunarmed Iraqi civilians,\nshooting them 60 times -- he\neven stopped to reload\nmade their opppsition to\nCordoba House the\ncenterpiece of midterm\ncongressional campaigns\nconducted hundreds of miles\nfrom Ground Zero.\nGeller\'s campaign against\n"the mosque at Ground\nZero" gained an unexpected\nassist and a veneer of\nlegitimacy from established\nJewish leaders like Anti-\nDefamation League\nNational Director Abraham\nFoxman. "Survivors of the\nHolocaust are entitled to\nfeelings that are irrational,"\nhe et.:narked to the New\nYork Times. Comparing the\nbereaved family members of\n9-1 1 victims to Holocaust\nsurvivors, Foxman insisted,\n"Their anguish entitles them\nto positions that others\nwould categorize as\nirrational or bigoted."\nSoon enough, David Harris,\ndirector of the (Chernick-\nfunded) American Jewish\nCommittee, was demanding\nthat Cordoba\'s leaders be\ncompelled to reveal their\n"true attitudes" about\nPalestinian militant groups\nbefore construction on the\ncenter was initiated. Rabbi\nMarvin Hier of the Simon\nWiesenthal Center of Los\nAngeles, another major\nJewish group, insisted it\nwould be "insensitive" for\nCordoba to build near "a\ncemetery," though his\norganization had recently\nbeen granted permission\nfrom the municipality of\nJerusalem to build a\n"museum of tolerance" to be\ncalled The Center for\nHuman Dignity directly on\ntop of the Mamilla\nCemetery, a Muslim\nGraveyard that contained\nthousands of grave sites\ndating back 1,200 years.\nInspiration from Israel\nIt was evident from the\ninvolvement of figures like\nGravers that the\nIslamophobic network in the\nUnited States represented a\ntrans-Atlantic expansion of\nsimmering resentment in\nEurope. There, the far-right\nwas storming to victories in\nparliamentary elections\nacross the continent in part\nby appealing to the\nsimmering anti-Muslim\nsentiments of voters in rural\nand working-class\ncommunities. The extent of\nthe collaboration between\nEuropean and American\nIslamophobes has only\ncontinued to grow with\nGeller, Spencer, and even\nGingrich standing beside\nEurope\'s most prominent\nanti-Muslim figure, Dutch\npad iamentarian Geed\nWilders, at a rally against\nCordoba House. In the\nmeantime. Geller was\nissuing statements of\nsunport for the Emdish\nDefense League, a band of\nuoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis\nand former members of the\nwhites-only British National\nParty who intimidate\nMuslims in the streets of\ncities like Birmingham and\nLondon.\nIn addition, the trans-\nAtlantic Islamophobic\ncrusade has stretched into\nIsrael, a country that has\ncome to symbolize the\nnetwork\'s fight against the\nMuslim menace. As Geller\ntold the New York Times\'\nAlan Feuer, Israel is "a very\ngood guide because, like I\nsaid, in the war between the\ncivilized man and the\nsavage, you side with the\ncivilized man."\nEDL members regularly\nwave Israeli flags at their\nrallies, while Wilders claims\nto have formed his views\nabout Muslims during the\ntime he worked on an Israeli\ncooperative farm in the\n1980s. He has, he says,\nvisited the country more\nthan 40 times since to meet\nwith rightist political allies\nlike Aryeh Eldad, a member\nof the Israeli Knesset and\nleader of the far right\nHatikvah faction of the\nNational Union Party. He\nhas called for forcibly\n"transferring" the\nPalestinians living in Israel\nand the occupied West Bank\nto Jordan and Egypt. On\nDecember 5th, for example,\nWilders traveled to Israel for\na \'ffrjend nieei,imr, with\nForeign Minister Avi2clor\nLieberman, then declared at\na press conference that\nIsrael should annex the West\nBank and set up a\nPalestinian state in Jordan.\nIn the apocalyptic clash of\ncivilizations the global anti-\nMuslim network has sought\nto incite, tiny armed Jewish\nsettlements like Yitzar,\nlocated on the hills above\nthe occupied Palestinian city\nof Nablus, represent front-\nline fortresses. Inside\nYitzar\'s state-funded\nyeshiva, a rabbi named\nYitzhak Shapira has\ninstructed students in what\nrules must be applied when\nconsidering killing non-\nJews. Shapira summarized\nhis opinions in a widely\npublicized book. Torat\nHaMelech, or The King\'s\nTorah. Claiming that non-\nJews are "uncompassionate\nby nature," Shapira cited\nrabbinical texts to declare\nthat gentiles could be killed\nin order to "curb their evil\ninclinations." "There is\njustification," the rabbi\nproclaimed, "for killing\nbabies if it is clear that they\nwill grow up to harm us, and,\nin such a situation they\' may\nbe harmed deliberately, and\nnot only during combat with\nadults."\nIn 2006, the rabbi was\nbriefly held by Israeli police\nfor urging his supporters to\nmurder all Palestinians over\nthe age of 13. Two years\nlater, according to the Israeli\nnewspaper Ilaaretz, he\na rabbinical letter in\nsupport of Israeli Jews who\nhad brutally assaulted two\nArab youths on the country\'s\nHolocaust Remembrance\nDay. That same year,\nShapira was arrested as a\nsuspect in helping\na rocket attack\nagainst a Palestinian village\nnear Nablus.\nThough he was not charged,\nhis name came up again in\nconnection with another act\nof terror when, in January\n2010, the Israeli police\nraided his settlement\nseeking vandals who had set\nfire to a nearby mosque.\nOne of Shapira\'s followers,\nan American immigrant,\nJack _Mite", has confessed to\nmurdering two innocent\nPalestinians and attempting\nto the kill the liberal Israeli\nhistorian Ze\'ev Sternhell\nwith a mail bomb.\nWhat does all this have to\ndo with Islamophobic\ncampaigns in the United\nStates? A great deal,\nactually. Through New\nYork-based tax-exempt non-\nprofits like the Central Fund\nof Israel and Ateret\nCohenim, for instance, the\nomnipresent Aubrey\nChernick has sent tens of\nthousands of dollars to\nsupport the Yitzar\nsettlement, as well as to the\nmessianic settlers dedicated\nto "Judaizing" East\nJerusalem. The settlement\nmovement\'s leading online\nnews magazine. Arutz\nSheva, has feattired Geller\nas a columnist. A friend of\nGeller\'s, Beth Gili.nsky, a\nright-wing activist with a\ngroup called the Coalition to\nHonor Ground Zero and the\nfounder of the Jewish\nAction Alliance (apparently\nttun. out of a Manhattan real\nestate office), organized a\nlarge rally in New York City\nin April 2010 to protest the\nObama administration\'s call\nfor a settlement freeze.\nAmong Chemick\'s major\nfunding recipients is a\nsupposedly "apolitical"\ngroup called Aish. Hatorah\nthat claims to educate Jews\nabout their heritage. Based\nin New York and active in\nthe fever swamps of\nnorthern West Bank\nsettlements near Yitzar,\nAish Hatorah shares an\naddress and staff with a\nshadowy foreign non-profit\ncalled the Clarion Fund.\nDuring the 2008 U.S.\nelection campaign, the\nClarion Fund distributed 28\nmillion DVDs of a\npropaganda film called\nObsession as newspaper\ninserts to residents of swing\nstates around the country.\nThe film featured a who\'s\nwho of anti-Muslim\nactivists, including \\Valid\nShoebat, a self-proclaimed\n"former PLO terrorist."\nAmong Shoebat\'s more\nstriking statements: "A\nsecular dogma like Nazism\nis less dangerous than is\nIslamofascism today." At a\nChristian gathering in 2007,\nthis "former Islamic\nterrorist" told the crowd that\nIslam was a "satanic cult"\nand that he had been born\nagain as an evangelical\nChristian. In 2008, however,\nthe Jerusalem Post, a right-\nleaning newspaper, exposed\nh rn as a fraud, whose\nclaims to terrorism were\nfictional.\nIslamophobic groups\nregistered only a minimal\nimpact during the 2008\nelection campaign. Two\nyears later, however, after\nthe Republicans regained\ncontrol of the House of\nRepresentatives in midterm\nelections, the network\nappears to have reached.\ncritical mass. Of course, the\ndeciding factor in the\nelection was the economy,\nand in two years, Americans\nwill likely vote their\npocketbooks again. But that\nthe construction of a single\nIslamic community center or\nthe imaginary threat of\nSharia law were issues at all\nreflected the influence of a\nsmall band of locally\noriented activists, and\nsuggested that when a\ncertain presidential\ncandidate who has already\nbeen demonized as a crypto-\nMuslim runs for reelection,\nthe country\'s most vocal\nIslamophobes could once\nagain find a national\nplatform amid the frenzied\natmosphere of the campaign.\nBy now, the Islamophobic\ncrusade has gone beyond the\nright-wing pro-Israel\nactivists, cyber-bigots, and\nambitious hucksters who\nconceived it. It now belongs\nto leading Republican\npresidential candidates, top-\nrated cable news hosts, and\ncrowds of Tea Party\nactivists. As the fervor\nspreads, the crusaders are\nbasking in the glory of what\nthey accomplished.

('sbwhoeop\nFriday, October 22, 2010 6:18 PM\nH: Iran hikers info. Sid\nJust now the NYT is reporting what I assume you already know, that the US hikers held prisoner in Iran were grabbed in\nIraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for\ndrug running and murder.\nIt seems that the hikers were too close to a drug trail. I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for\nEurope in next few days. Sid\nUS Hikers Were Seized in Iraq\nBy Babak Sarfaraz\nPosted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010\nhttp://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/\nKURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN—\nSince their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq\nborder, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and\nSarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes\ndiplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian\nauthorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran\nto conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the\nthree, along with the State Department, the Committee to\nProtect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund\n[Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in\nThe Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying\ncharge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed\nthe border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well-\npublicized visit by the detainees\' mothers in May, Iran has\nreleased little information about the circumstances of their\narrest or the status of their case.\nThe Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two\nwitnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and\nShourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not\nin Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional\nsources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who\nlikely ordered their detention has since been arrested on\ncharges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder.\nThe witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called\nZalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they\ndeclined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian\nforces, who have been known to conduct missions across the\nborder. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three\nAmericans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal\nregion, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies\nin Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and\noccasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked,\nalthough local residents are familiar with its boundaries.\nThe witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out\nof curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers\ndescended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA,\nIran\'s national police force, waved the hikers toward the\nIranian side using "threatening" and "menacing" gestures.\nWhen their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into\nthe air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked\na few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction,\nand apprehended them.\nThese witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made\non May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel\nbetween the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times\nreported, Bauer "denied that they had walked into Iran, as\nthey were accused of doing, before stopping himself and\nsaying, \'We can\'t really talk about that."\nFarhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed\nthat the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a\ncross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily\nTelegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had\nseen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the\nTelegraph that the hikers "were targeted and captured by a\ngroup that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraq\'s sovereignty.\nWe know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take\nAmericans hostage at this sensitive time."\nA State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware\nof evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but\nwould not comment further.\nOnce captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to\nthe local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in\nMarivan, a town close to the border in the province of\nKurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the\nAmericans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva\nTaab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards\' intelligence\nunit in the region. According to these sources — a former\nmember of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who\nserves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab\nwould have had the authority to order the Americans\'\ndetention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the\nIranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the\nRevolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining\nnational security throughout the Islamic Republic.\n"When I heard the news that they had arrested American\nhikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the\nintelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they\nhave people in this region," says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian\nKurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar\nat Georgetown University. "I thought they were most likely\nlured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It\nis consistent with Iran\'s past actions."\nLess than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself\nwas arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of\nMostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of\nMarivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi\'s nephew\nwas also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has\nbeen implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a\nprofitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes\nand kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official,\nnumerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against\nTaab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and\nmurder. Taab\'s case has twice been before a judge, and he\nawaits execution in a Tehran prison.\nAlthough the state-run Iranian press has not reported on\nTaab\'s crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in\nJanuary and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va\nKurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A\nFebruary 17 article describes Taab as the head of a "criminal\nband" and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were\nunder arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a\nvast number of illegal killings.\nSeveral sources describe Taab as the central power in\nKurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control\nof the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in\nparticular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local\ndivision had been commanded by Taab for about five years.\n"At this point it\'s really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards,\nthat are in charge, especially in the western provinces,\nespecially because the Americans are on the other side, in\nIraq," says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of\ninternational studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert\nwho serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East\nReport. "On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in\ncharge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control\nthe borders."\nIt is a region where, according to several Iran experts,\nsmuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran\nborder is "relatively porous because it\'s mountainous," says\nFaraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch,\nwhich issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian\nKurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape\nroute for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates\nand Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route\nfor goods. "Smuggling is something that has taken place and\ncontinues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of\nhumans across the border. It\'s something that happens quite\noften."\nSoon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern\nquadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the\nblack-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj\nofficial and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who\nhad firsthand knowledge of Taab\'s activities, Taab\'s first\nscheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty\nsmugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods\nacross the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time\nfor Drunken Horses, which won the Camera d\'Or at Cannes\nin 2000).\nThe region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist\ngroups that have been demanding autonomy from the central\nTehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in\nKurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\'\nParty, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed\nconflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist\norganization by the United States and other governments.\nSince 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq,\nhas been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed\nresponsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards\nsoldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as\nwell as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military\nhelicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in\nWestern Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian\nsoldiers.\nIt has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants\nenjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis\nKucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether\nthe US government was "fomenting opposition and\nsupporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups\nand Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are\noperating from Iraq." Kucinich named two groups, including\nPJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in\nThe New Yorker that "Israel and the United States have also\nbeen working together in support of a Kurdish resistance\ngroup known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan," and that\na government consultant told him that the Israeli government\nhad provided "equipment and training" to PJAK.\nThe United States and Israel have denied any involvement\nwith PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained\nsubstantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded\nTaab\'s decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as\nthe repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In\nearly April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar\nMoslehi told Iran\'s Press TV that "it is quite obvious to us\nthat the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links\nwith Western and Israeli intelligence services."\nThe Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish\nmilitancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside\nIran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for\nexample, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked\nseveral villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June\n4, officials in Iraq\'s semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged\nthat "a small unit of Iranian soldiers," including a tank and\nseveral other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into\nIraqi Kurdistan\'s Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels.\nUntil his arrest, Taab was a key player in Iran\'s counter-\noffensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that\nseveral current members of the Guards told him that Taab\'s\nstated goal was to "completely wipe out PJAK" in his\njurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at\nGeorgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border\nassassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The\nKurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit\nassassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008.\nAccording to the former officer and the Sanandaj official,\nTaab\'s criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007,\nwhen he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty\nborder smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally\nshot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap\nkoolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish\ncivilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and\nthen kill them—claiming they\'d died in a military clash—in\norder to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his\nsuperiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this\nplot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been\napprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named\nall seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha,\nidentified as a ringleader.\nPJAK has officially denied involvement in these border\nclashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian\nwebsite Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a\nformer head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK\nclashes may, in fact, have been "bogus," said the Sanandaj\nofficial. "More or less no clashes with PJAK have been\nreported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were\nbusted."\nA mother of one koolbar tearfully described her son\'s\ndisappearance. She said he went missing the same day in\nearly 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with\nPJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border\ntown in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits\nagainst Taab; she asked that her name and location not be\nmentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court.\nTaab\'s scheme was wildly successful, according to the\nSanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taab\'s\nname has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008.\nThis macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when\nTaab killed a local official\'s brother who was seeking work in\nthe area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the\ncleric\'s son.\nOn June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of\nIran\'s High Council for Human Rights, said that the\ngovernment\'s investigation was nearly complete and a trial\nfor Bauer, Fattal and Shourd "should not be very far from\nnow." In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the\nhikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their\nchildren. "Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to\nrelease them or move forward with a fair trial in which our\nchildren can openly answer any allegations against them."\n"These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have\nbeen victims of political machinations and manipulation,"\nsaid Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International\nCampaign for Human Rights in Iran. "The fact that they have\nbeen held for so long without prosecution strongly supports\nthis trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime\nand should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer,\nwho has studied the judicial files against them, has\nconsistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal\nentry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for\nso long. With this new information, even that charge appears\nfabricated, and there is no basis for holding them."\nAs of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah\nShourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and\ntwenty-three days.\nThis article was reported in collaboration with the\nInvestigative Fund at The Nation Institute.

GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN\nIran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of\nthem in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when\nthe hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized.\nThe initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said\nthat the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were\nclose to the border but on the Iraqi side.\nThe episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a\nmountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his\nfriends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31.\nA July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a "female called him saying they were being\nsurrounded by armed men."\nAt first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army\ndivision based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a "kidnapping" and said the three\nAmerican tourists "were being taken to the Iranian border."\nThe report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained\n— all on the Iraqi side of the border.\nAs documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to\nsupport the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft\nwas sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces\nwere sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning.\nAs the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in\nnorthern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens "for being too close to the border." The July report\nreflects some frustration with the hikers for their "lack of coordination" in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some\nthoughts on the episode\'s broader implications.\n"The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal\ndissension," it notes.

('Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin\nThere is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I\nthink it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I\ndidn\'t see and whom I didn\'t meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear\nlimitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn\'t see -\nwould be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,\nit rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,\nmanagement, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite\nconceivably confront tens of thousands of children\'s deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,\ntyphoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major\ntakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)\ncould to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the\nnear and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I\nwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with\ngrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.\nPlease do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me\nfirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.\nThanks,\nChelsea\nTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of\nimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:\nHaitians want to help themselves and want the international community to\nhelp them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn\'t to some of the\nUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I\nencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off\nLogbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and\nincompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me\nshe was waiting for the Haitians to "demand their political rights" - when\nthey\'re asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)\nIn fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,\nin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/\nINGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures\nhave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie\nVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head\nof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a\nwomen\'s committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a\nsoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\ntshirts - at least though I think they\'ll need at least 2-3x that - so that the\nsecurity volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,\nparticularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups\nof 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.\nFinally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less\nimportant than the first two \'asks\'). IF that option were not feasible, their\nsecond choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at\nnight. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They\nwanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.\nThe settlements\' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are\nbeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\ntheir needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\nresidents themselves\nThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\nrebuilding over next -5 years)\nThe Haitian government\'s inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to \'help,\' some of\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\nsupplies in camps even though it\'s a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\n-40k though given the settlements\' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\nwhile most sit in darkness)\nThis disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\non the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was\n"such a waste of time" and he said that is representative of the government\'s\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\nwere "more efficient." This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\nAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\naround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\nasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au\nPrince UN \'bases\' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\n"UN" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\nUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements\' residents, by\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\ncentral locations\nThere is NO accountability in the UN system or international\nhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn\'t tell the residents when they\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\nRed Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ \'do\' latrines\nThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\nimportant no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\nlatrines; \'guard\' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\nRe: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they\'re starting to\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli\nAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4\nsettlements for at least the next month.\nThe World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\nnext week.\nIn contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\nguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti \'ONG\' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\ndoctors I met said, "We must be so poor we can\'t tell them [UN and INGOs]\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves."). There is also\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\nOn an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church\'s efforts is\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\nThoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this\nis familiar.):\nThe Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN\nand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\notherwise it could be "empowered" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\nThere needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\nA plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\nOn pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\nwages until a \'market\' could develop\nThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\nsettlements at the minimum\nSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\nlocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don\'t think anyone expects an\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\nSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\nnow offered to rebuild\nHolistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\nThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\nRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\nnon-earthquake related cases.\nRe: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\nthe transfer plan is\nRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\nRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\nabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\nRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it\'s the best plan, but it is a plan and we\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\nRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic\ngroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would\nbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work\nRe: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and\nex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can\'t process right now\nFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:\no Near term/ for the next year\n■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not\nin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in\nplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or\nbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security\nand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);\nensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the\nyoungest children.\n▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst\ngeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other\nreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime\nminister\'s lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements\nelsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO\nShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close\nto one another\n• Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above\ndiscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go\nwhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services\nonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how\nto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to\nsecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least\n2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec\nof tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,\nschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for older\nchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial school\nplan; how to best support / help create where needed\nsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,\nwho is in the settlements\n® Over next 6-12 months:\no Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families\nto return to and subsequently encourage them to do\nso; government estimates this will be —30% of all\nhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no\nevidence base)\n• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-\nexisting villages around Port Au Prince where\nfeasible to enable the government to move people\nout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move\n400-1000 families to each of these as needed\no Longer-term:\n• Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people\nwould move back or what the government\'s post-rebuild\nvision looks like\n■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed\nbefore the earthquake\n■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the "plan"\nContext\nI spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in\nHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday\nafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region\nSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul\'s formal meetings in Port Au Prince\nwith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian\ngovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison\nLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs\nassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving \'voice to\nthe voiceless,\' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices\nof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of\nCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in\nbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,\nincluding people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling\nwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person\nwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,\nClinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to\nmove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in\nsettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian\ndoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,\nnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc\nresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our\nnights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers\n(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,\nas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on\nand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,\nhead of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.',)

One of\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\ntshirts -though I think they\'ll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security\nvolunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly\nwomen, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3.\nThey also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they\nwanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important\nthan the first two `asks\'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice\nwas for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the\nHaitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help\nthemselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their\npartners.\nThe settlements\' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are\nbeginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\ntheir needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\nresidents themselves\nThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\nrebuilding over next -5 years)\nThe Haitian government\'s inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to \'help,\' some of\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\nsupplies in camps even though it\'s a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\n-40k though given the settlements\' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\nwhile most sit in darkness)\nThis disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\non the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was\n"such a waste of time" and he said that is representative of the government\'s\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\nwere "more efficient." This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\nAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\naround in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\nasked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au\nPrince UN \'bases\' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\n"UN" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\nUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements\' residents, by\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\ncentral locations\nThere is NO accountability in the UN system or international\nhumanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn\'t tell the residents when they\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\nRed Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ \'do\' latrines\nThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\nimportant no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\nlatrines; \'guard\' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\nRe: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they\'re starting to\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli\nAgency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4\nsettlements for at least the next month.\nThe World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\nnext week.\nIn contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\nguarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti \'ONG\' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\ndoctors I met said, "We must be so poor we can\'t tell them [UN and INGOs]\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves."). There is also\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\nOn an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church\'s efforts is\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\nThoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this\nis familiar.):\nThe Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN\nand all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\notherwise it could be "empowered" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\nThere needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\nA plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\nOn pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\nwages until a \'market\' could develop\nThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\nsettlements at the minimum\nSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\nlocals) laying effectively fallow - and I don\'t think anyone expects an\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\nSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\nnow offered to rebuild\nHolistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\nThe UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\nRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\nnon-earthquake related cases.\nRe: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\nthe transfer plan is\nRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\nRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\nabout this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\nRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it\'s the best plan, but it is a plan and we\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\nRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic\ngroups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would\nbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work\nRe: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and\nex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can\'t process right now\nFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:\no Near term/ for the next year\n■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not\nin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in\nplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or\nbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security\nand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);\nensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the\nyoungest children.\n■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst\ngeographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other\nreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime\nminister\'s lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements\nelsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO\nShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close\nto one another\n■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above\ndiscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go\nwhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services\nonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how\nto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to\nsecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least\n2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec\nof tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation,\nschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for older\nchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial school\nplan; how to best support / help create where needed\nsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,\nwho is in the settlements\n■ Over next 6-12 months:\n• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families\nto return to and subsequently encourage them to do\nso; government estimates this will be —30% of all\nhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no\nevidence base)\n• Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-\nexisting villages around Port Au Prince where\nfeasible to enable the government to move people\nout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move\n400-1000 families to each of these as needed\no Longer-term:\n■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people\nwould move back or what the government\'s post-rebuild\nvision looks like\n■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed\nbefore the earthquake\n■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the "plan"\nContext\nI spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in\nHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday\nafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region\nSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul\'s formal meetings in Port Au Prince\nwith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian\ngovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison\nLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs\nassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving \'voice to\nthe voiceless,\' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices\nof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of\nCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in\nbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,\nincluding people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling\nwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person\nwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,\nClinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to\nmove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in\nsettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian\ndoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,\nnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc\nresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our\nnights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers\n(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,\nas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on\nand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,\nhead of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.',)

('Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it\'s definitely worth reading\nA few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with\nthe Middle East follow.\nFrom Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that\nNetanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with\nbelieved that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its\nexpiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a\nlarge majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him\nleverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud\nvoters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state\nsolution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership).\nLieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi\'s chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as\npossible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud,\nwho oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to\nkeep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the\ngovernment now, and is willing to do so without any demand for "rotation," provided Bibi is serious about\nnegotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against\nthe idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows\nKadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5.\nTherefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The\nlonger he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to\noppose him in the next elections.\nIn this context, Bibi\'s negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that\nhe is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the\nbelief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable\nprice uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises\ndoubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final\nconcession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no\ncredit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This\ncombines with his legendary fear of being seen as a "freier" (sucker) in front of his people to create a real\nproblem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards.\nThis is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of "creative ideas." Thinking out of the box, as he\nlikes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to\nbroaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct\nnegotiations provide the opportunity to build trust.\nThe reason for dwelling on Bibi\'s psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of\nmaking a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn\'t make a serious move, it will further\ndelegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President\nObama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling\nrelations with the U.S.; and if he doesn\'t make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance\nthe future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership.\nYuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky\n(unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent\nterror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will\ndisappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi\ndoesn\'t quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been\nseriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but\nthat Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too.\nWhat is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And\nplease forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know.\n1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working\nwith him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge\nhim forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands.\n2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own\npurposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel\'s security,\nfrom the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted\nBibi\'s security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him.\n3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in\nterms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about\nAbu Mazen\'s politics.\n4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a "clarifying moment." The world will of course blame\nBibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated\nsolution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they\'re ready. The\nIsraeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and\nthey should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations\nand time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as\nwe keep the door open.\nFrom my staffer:\nAM\nAnne-Marie Slaughter\nDirector of Policy Planning\nU.S. Department of State\n(202) 647-2972',)

('sbwhoeop\nFriday, December 3, 2010 9:55 AM\nH: Roger Cohen in NYT: "American Diplomacy Revealed — as Good"\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hp\nDecember 2, 2010\nAmerican Diplomacy Revealed as Good\nBy ROGER COHEN\nNEW YORK — Let\'s hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service!\nThey are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed\nand dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences.\nI\'ve not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now\ncondemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their\ncorrespondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give\nevery journalist pause.\nSo it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more\nconspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be\nadded.\nJulian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow\nspectrum. That will satisfy him in that he\'s a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy.\nPerhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the "shock" of venal Gulf Arab Sunni\nleaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn\'t disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the\n"shock" of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the "shock" of yet more premature Israeli predictions\non when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the "shock" of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the "shock" of the\nChinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the "shock" of Muammar el-Qaddafi\'s taste for voluptuous Slavic women and\nSilvio Berlusconi\'s taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on\nembarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to\nthe familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: "hyperactive," "mercurial," "authoritarian," "erratic,"\n"monarch-like."\nI swear, if they hadn\'t become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks.\nOverall, my longstanding admiration for America\'s conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this\nunderreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: "While\nwe don\'t know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels\nand that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad \'won\nbig\' in the first round."\nIt is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran\nduring the election and its violent aftermath.\nA couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about\nTehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United\nStates. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle\nEast more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis.\nThe second is that President Barack Obama\'s approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach\nsuggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Ross\'s tired thinking\nabout balancing "appetizing carrots" with "sharp sticks" in tackling Iran\'s nuclear program.\nThe cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking "dual track," telling Europeans that\n"engagement alone is unlikely to succeed" and calling for added "pressure." Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have\nbeen overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester.\nAssange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he\nexpressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "coming out with a very interesting statement that\nleaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can" and bought into Netanyahu\'s view that this, in\nAssange\'s words, would "lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation\nto Iran.\nIt\nHuh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders\' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he\nalso favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He\'s all over the place.\nWhat should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He\'s a\nloose canon; let him be. My impression is he\'s self-armed with a spade and he\'s digging.\nAnd what of the messenger\'s message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of\ndiscovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the\ncourageous work of America\'s diplomats and may endanger lives. That\'s a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.',)
