The Council, in this context, condemns those acts\\nwhich resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their\\nfamilies. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The\\nCouncil urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and\\nwounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The\\nSecurity Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into\\nthe matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international\\nstandards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the\\nimportance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at\\nthe humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as\\nwell as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council\\nunderscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties\\nand re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in\\npeace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region.

      "**Key Points and Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netanyahu's Position:** Netanyahu is politically stable with a strong ruling coalition, allowing him to garner support for extending the settlement freeze without causing his government to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Lieberman's Influence:** Lieberman is Netanyahu's main concern within the government. Netanyahu fears Lieberman will join forces with right-wing elements to oppose peacemaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Kadima's Willingness:** Tzipi Livni states that her party, Kadima, is willing to join the government and negotiate peace, without demanding rotation in leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time Constraints:** The longer Netanyahu delays a peace deal with Abu Mazen, the less leverage he has over Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will oppose him in future elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netanyahu's Negotiating Tactics:** Netanyahu's inflated demands and belief in his negotiating skills are seen as counterproductive. He raises expectations and humiliates negotiating partners, making it difficult to find common ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Creative Ideas:** Netanyahu's introduction of \"creative ideas\" is believed to delay negotiations by expanding the parameters beyond what is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Palestinian Motivation:** Yuval Diskin warns that if Netanyahu does not demonstrate seriousness to Abu Mazen, Palestinian security services may lose their motivation to prevent terror due to disillusionment with state-building prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Consequences of Netanyahu's Tactics:** Diskin suggests that continued delay may force Abu Mazen and Salam Fayyad to resign, leading to an uncertain future of Palestinian leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Recommendations for U.S. Action:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    * **Engage with Netanyahu:** Work with him to nudge him forward but challenge his political fears and inflated demands.\n",
      "    * **Emphasize Counterproductive Tactics:** Explain how Netanyahu's negotiating tactics undermine his own goals.\n",
      "    * **Highlight Strategic Consequences:** Outline the potential consequences of Netanyahu's actions on the Palestinian leadership and stability.\n",
      "    * **Avoid Recriminations:** In case of failure, avoid blaming others and reiterate commitment to a negotiated solution.\n",
      "    * **Keep the Door Open:** Despite challenges, keep diplomatic channels open as all parties involved will eventually return to the table.\n",
