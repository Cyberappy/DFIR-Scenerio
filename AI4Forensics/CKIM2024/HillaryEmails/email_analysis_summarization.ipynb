      "Error processing line: (\"Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a\\ncall.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick:\\nThe Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the\\ncivilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet\\nreiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israel's legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons\\nsmuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the\\nreunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of\\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council\\nresolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and\\ninternational donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of\\nthe Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution.\\nConsistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as\\nconsulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in\\nGaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet\\nnotes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the\\neffectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards\\nmeeting the needs of Gaza's population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and\\ninfrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work\\nwith Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as\\nquickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in\\nconsultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will\\nactively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and\\npromote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza.\\nThe Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local\\nnon-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully\\nenable this work.\\nThe Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes\\nefforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The\\nQuartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and\\nammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their\\ncargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for\\nunnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza.\\nThe Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his\\ncapture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas' international obligation to provide him access by the\\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation.\\nThe Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct\\nbilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these\\nnegotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation\\nwhich began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the\\nWest Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.\",)\n",

      "Error processing line: ('You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be\\nridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions\\nhas created a needless PR disaster, not least for the US, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one\\ninternationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for\\nhis political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs, yes,\\nyes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. This\\nincident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is a\\ndownward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S\\n14 16, 2010, 11:01 pm\\nChomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel\\nBy ROBERT MACKEY\\nNoam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West\\nBank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a\\nlecture.\\nAmira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported:\\nNo reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge\\nborder crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky\\'s intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel.\\nChomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on\\nMonday.\\nA spokeswoman for Israel\\'s interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and \"officials were\\ntrying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.\"\\nIn a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, \"the facts were\\ncompletely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.\" He explained that he was interrogated for\\nseveral hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year-\\nold scholar added:\\nI can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he\\nwas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was\\nthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose\\nevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an\\ninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past\\nbut not this time.\\nMr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the\\nPalestinian university in Ramallah.\\nThe renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and\\nhas criticized Israel\\'s occupation of Palestinian territory many times.\\nIn an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, \"I objected to the\\nfounding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don\\'t think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object\\nto the United States as a Christian state.\" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying,\\n\"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,\" he replied:\\nIt is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It\\'s grotesque. If an Italian\\ncriticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?\\n• Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company\\n• Privacy Policy\\n• NYTimes.com 620 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10018',)\n",
